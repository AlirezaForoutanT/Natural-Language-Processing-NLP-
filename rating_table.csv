It's a collection of her photos -- about 80 pages worth with a nice section of paintings by Olivia.If you're looking for heavy literary content, this isn't the place to find it -- there's only about 2 pages with text and everything else is photos.Bottom line: if you only want one book, the Six Foot One ... is probably a better choice, however, if you like Julie like I like Julie, you won't go wrong on this one either.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,5.0,Really Enjoyed It,"I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,5.0,Essential for every personal and Public Library,"If people become the books they read and if ""the child is father to the man,"" then Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is the most influential author, poet, and artist of modern times. For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, ""the other sides of Dr. Seuss"" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a ""must buy"" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,4.0,Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment,"Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E. Perry of Nolensville, Tennessee, is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,4.0,Good academic overview,"Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to ""cash in"" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,4.0,One of America's greatest creative talents,"""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the ""Disneyification"" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes ""threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism"". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,5.0,A memorably excellent survey of Dr. Seuss' many achievements,"Theodor Seuss Giesel was best known as 'Dr. Seuss', one of the most influential and enduringly popular children's authors of the 20th century. Giesel created not only his famous imaginative picturebooks, but a unique art and poetry, and even a place for himself in politics. Philip Nel argues that these added activities make Dr. Seuss one of the most influential people in America - certainly the most influential poet - and Dr. Seuss: American Icon provides the reader an memorably excellent survey of Dr. Seuss' many achievements.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,5.0,Academia At It's Best,"When I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas my first impression went along these line: ""Oh great some professor who probably wrote alot of mumbo-jumbo that I don't want to know about Dr. Suess and I know it won't be an enjoyable read.""Thanks goodness I read it nonetheless.To my pleasure, Nel hardly writes in the airy academia style with which I expected him to. In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. ""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more. Highly recommended!",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,5.0,And to think that I read it on the tram!,"Trams (or any public transport) are not usually the best place to read and absorb scholarly texts. But this one has accompanied me on my daily commute, and I have been absorbed in it. It is well written and comprehensive, and tells the tale of a modern author, with plenty of ""Fancy that"" and ""Well, well"" moments. Highly recommended for stationary reading, too.",positive
0826414346,Dr. Seuss: American Icon,4.0,Fascinating account of a genius at work,"As far as I am aware, this is the first book-length study of the work of Dr. Seuss, and Philip Nel has done an excellent job. If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don't believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics. Secondly, the dust jacket on my copy was a little loose.",positive
0829814000,Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,5.0,Outstanding Resource for Small Church Pastors,"I just finished the book, &quot;Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,&quot; by David Ray, an outstanding resource for small church pastors, as is his other book, &quot;The Big Small Church Book.&quot; I will be rereading both regularly and referring to them often. I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more.",positive
0829814000,Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,5.0,Small Churches CAN Have Wonderful Worship,"Many small churches feel like they can not have great worship because they lack the resources that larger churches take for granted.Ray's list of ""thou shalts"" is worth the price of the book.The description of various ""personalities"" in the small church is both humorous, and so true.This book gives encouragement as well as practical advice.",positive
0829814000,Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,5.0,Not Just for Pastors!,"I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!",positive
0829814000,Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,5.0,Small church pastor? This is the book on worship,"I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the ""Thou Shalts"" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!",positive
0595344550,Whispers of the Wicked Saints,1.0,not good,"I bought this book because I read some glowing praise on an online library site. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed by page three. I always buy books in the hope and expectation of having an enjoyable read, not to criticise. However, this book is in urgent need of good editing -- though quite possibly editing alone wouldn't save it. Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three. It is quite possible that the storyline is deeply moving. I'll never know because I can't bring myself to continue. Sorry.",negative
0595344550,Whispers of the Wicked Saints,4.0,Here is my opinion,"I have to admit, I am not one to write reviews on book. I do however like to read them. Some of the reviews are great, some are cruel, but the reviews on this book were absolutlely hysterical. I read this book and after watching the war of the words I couldn't help, but to jump in. I am on the good side of the book. I loved how it kept my intersted. On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the ""Traveling librarian"" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game. Maybe it is someone who dislikes the author for personal reasons, that has posted more then one awful review, or maybe this is another who is jealous, Who knows? All I know is that I liked the book, and future readers take the advice of the ignorant with a grain of salt.",positive
0595344550,Whispers of the Wicked Saints,1.0,Buyer beware,"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",negative
0595344550,Whispers of the Wicked Saints,5.0,Fall on your knee's,When I first read this the I was mezmerized at the style of writting.

0595344550,Whispers of the Wicked Saints,5.0,Bravo Veronica,"I read the review directly under mine and I have to say I laughed. How can someone write a honest review on a book they read only three pages of? That was funny but also sad that people are mean enough to keep others from an enjoyable read. I loved this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long, but I read the WHOLE book and I loved it. This book is about an afair of the heart and the right to be happy. It is a glimps into the lives of those who are forbiden to love each other. This is a heart warming story.

0595344550,Whispers of the Wicked Saints,5.0,Wonderful,"I really enjoyed the book. I believe the author did a good job at tackeling the subject of poor conduct in the church. I was reminded that we are all human, and even the mighty shall fall. Now I have to speak my mind regarding the poor reviews. I was shocked at the bahavior of ""adults"" What happened to respect for others. In my opinion I have to say those who wrote the mean reviews are nothing short of ignorent and without a doubt low class. Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book? Obviously not many because you all have way too much time on your hands. I liked the book, and remember that those of you in glass houses should not throw stones.",positive

I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect...

However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler. It is a self-published, self-edited (and extremely poorly edited, I might add), and self-promoted lame excuse for a novel. My eyes rolled constantly while reading this book. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did. The best part of this book is the short length. There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon.

""The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him."" Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction.

0595344550,Whispers of the Wicked Saints,1.0,awful beyond belief,"I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the ""wicked saints"" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on ""other reviews"" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book.

The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of ""nations"" across the waters.",positive
0802841899,The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today,5.0,Ecclesiological Milestone,"With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled ""The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,"" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the ""rock"" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to ""the gates of Hades will not prevail"" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, ""The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,"" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, ""people of God,"" ""body of Christ,"" and ""community of the Spirit."" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, ""The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership."" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: ""Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God"" (pg. 170); ""Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord"" (pg. 180); and, ""Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness"" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do"" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, ""The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly"" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. ""The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry"" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, ""The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life."" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder.",positive

Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values.

True to form, the &quot;New Young&quot; of Japan seem to be creating an &quot;international&quot; blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out.

No filters are between us and the experiences he had day to day. All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn't even speak English good, end of quote. Couldn't even speak English GOOD? Neither can the exchange students it seems.All in all, you need to get it. Used, paperback, in hardcover, any version you can. Just get it.",positive
0854968350,Muslim Women's Choices: Religious Belief and Social Reality (Cross Cultural Perspectives on Women),5.0,Excellent,"This is an excellent book. It offers the opinions of a diverse sample of real Muslim Women with very different attitudes. It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular.",positive

0918973031,Dramatica for Screenwriters,2.0,Thoroughly Confusing,"I purchased this book based on the other reviews claiming that it ""demystifies"" the Dramatica theory and software. Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it (""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for ""Dramatica For Screenwriters"", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in ""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place.

The way I see it, you will need lots of paper, patience and time, say 30 minutes or so to solve even the easiest of these.Why? Because basically, you are asked how many combinations can be formed from such and such. Example: How many ways get 31241 by adding prime numbers only? This is not really what the problems are like in the book, they are far more complicated than that.For me, it's just too much. I can't even do 1 single problem. I can't even look up the answers because uses some sort of a legend that I can't understand. But if you have an above average intelligence or are mathematically gifted, you will probably find some obscure short cut to the problem a la Gauss. For the rest, forget it.Word of warning: these are purely number problems. I can't tell if logic will help or even plays a part in this book, but the problems are NUMBER problems.",neutral

However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide.",neutral

0809080699,"The Repeal of Reticence: A History of America's Cultural and Legal Struggles over Free Speech, Obscenity, Sexual Liberation, and Modern Art",5.0,Great treatment of the defeat of reticence by exposure,"Using a quiet, restrained writing style that is a pure pleasure to read, Gurstein chronicles the one-sided battle between the party of exposure and the party of reticence. She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language.

At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book ""Aerobics"" (a term he coined), then to ""Aerobics Program for total Well Being..."", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book ""Start Strong, Finish Strong"" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading.",positive

B000NKGYMK,Alaska Sourdough,5.0,A Bit of Heaven,"I got this book because of all the interesting stories and sourdough tidbits that it contained. The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled ""sour cream sour"" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn't want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven't had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, ""It is a slice of Heaven!"". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting.

I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don't expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast? The kinds in this book!I'm not claiming to be an expert on bread, but I've made two loaves a week for 2 years now, with a lot of success with other cookbooks (America's Bread Book, The Bread Book, My Bread); I think this one is lame.

B000NKGYMK,Alaska Sourdough,3.0,Not your quick refrence cookbook,"After having a chance to read through the book I am not sure I would have bothered purchasing it in a store. The ""sourdough lore"" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more ""authentically old"" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don't know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can't cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don't have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick!

B000NKGYMK,Alaska Sourdough,3.0,Sourdough...Alaska style,"Frankly, ""Alaska Sourdough"" will not suit everyone's tastes. Don't get me wrong, ""Alaska Sourdough"" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from ""on the trail"" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers.""Alaska Sourdough"" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of ""Alaska Sourdough"" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation.",neutral

0195178548,The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford Handbooks),5.0,Robert Kane's *The Oxford Handbook on Free Will*,"Do you want to brought up to speed on the state of the art in philosophical discussions of free will? Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book.",positive
0195178548,The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford Handbooks),5.0,Oxford and Kane have done it again!,"So far forth, the editors of the Oxford Handbook series have managed to put together products which both the neophyte and the fully-informed scholar will find beneficial. Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended.",positive
0195178548,The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford Handbooks),5.0,Kane's Compilation Will Leave You Proud To Lose An Argument,"I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P.

0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,5.0,A Superlative Planning Aide and Top-level Guide,"This book was tailor made for our trip, which was for 3 weeks, hitting 8 major cities. It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for ""getting our heads in the game"" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn't get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven't decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn't buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don't see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can't fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn't cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven't started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!",positive

0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,5.0,Good Overall Idea,"I really like the eyewitness guides, I have seven including ""Europe"". All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more ""popular"" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each.",positive

The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is.

0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,4.0,Colourful Digest Of Places To See In Europe,"I bought this book to help me plan my trip to Europe and it was so useful, it was the only book I packed to take on my trip. The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the ""tiny"" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn't judge how ""good"" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you.",positive
0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,5.0,Going to Europe? Get this book!,"If you're already a fan of the Eyewitness Travel Guide series, you know what to expect from this book. If this is your first time, let me tell you you'll be amazed with how great and how useful this book is.This particular guide summarizes the contents of over 20 other books by DK, including information for 20 countries in total, organized in the following way:- The British Isles (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)- France and the low countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg &amp; The Netherlands)- The Iberian Peninsula (Spain &amp; Portugal)- Italy and Greece- Germany, Austria and Switzerland- Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark &amp; Finland)- Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary &amp; Poland).This guide contains, for every country, information regarding sites to visit, hotels, restaurants, shopping, museums, travel info (how tos for travelling by train, bus, car, metro, etc). Worthy of notice are their trademark cutaways of castles and churches, maps and street-by-street graphics.The only drawback is that since it includes information on so many countries, some of it might not have the detail you'd expect. For example, the France section has only 73 pages, while the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris (another book from DK) has over 350 pages on Paris alone!A phenomenal guide if you're planning on visiting many countries on one trip, but if you intend to dedicate more time to just a couple, you'd be better off getting the specific country/city guides.",positive
0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,5.0,The Major Sights in Twenty Countries - Amazing!,"Yes, this is one heavy book. It is more than likely not a guide you want to carry around with you unless you intend to lose a few pounds from the extra weight in your backpack. Otherwise, it is quite a great guide for deciding where you want to take your next vacation in Europe. It is filled with color photography, illustrations and details you wil enjoy reading. It is graphically exciting and visually pleasing. Of all the guides I've seen, the Eyewitness Travel Guides are sheer brillance.On the inside cover there is a map of Europe and then the pages are color coded so you can find the following countries: Great Britian, Ireland, France, Belgium & Luxembourge, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.So, if you wanted to find the information on France, you just turn the book sideways and look for the yellow markings on the pages. Viola, you are there. If you are dreaming about visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or want to go see the Hall of Mirrors at the Chateau de Versailles, may I say...they are worth a plane ticket to France. Finding a bottle of Huile D' Olive in the South of France is also something you won't soon forget.There is also a guide to Europe's Rail Network and the Index is perfect.After you look through the main spots to visit in each country, there is a section filled with practical information: Visa Requirements and customs, tourist information, personal security issues, climate, banking, communications, directory for embassies, travel information like car rental and buses, etc. Then there is a shopping and entertainment. So where do you want to stay? There is a guide giving the hotel ratings and it is divided up by the areas you might enjoy visiting. Then, there is a guide to places to eat. While finding a restaurant just by exploring can be exciting, there is something to be said for a guide. Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go.

0789480662,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Europe,4.0,Helpful guide on tours through Europe,"I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the ""Museum of Arsenal"" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well.",positive

It should be used to maybe narrow down places to visit- then more comprehensive guides should be used. I have never been a believer in those 1 and 2 days in 18 cities over 3 weeks tours. 1 or 2 days is certainly not enough time to fully appreciate and get to know any city you visit. Furthermore, this guides biggest flaw is in doesn't cover anything in central/eastern europe besides the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary! Where's Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, etc....? Yes, Europe is big but the countries not contained in this guide have so much to offer and certainly should not be overlooked. For example, St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - not mentioned here!Don't rush Europe - relax and enjoy it. Take time to get to know the people and cities.

On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money?

I had this book and one other with me on my trip and this was the only book I opened the entire journey.The best part about this book was all of the illustrations and color photographs. This book shows you what the other guides only tell you. It's hard to tell what building your looking at if you only have a written description, but with the four color illustrations in this book things are easy to identify and find.

Lightly covers the character of each city. I do enjoy the pictures and diagrams in the book. I highly recommend having another guide book that covers more logistics. I used this book along with Rick Steves Europe 2007. They were great companions to one another. My other complaint is that I am a student with a budget. This book does not cover many (if any) cheap places to eat or sleep. It does tell you which places charge admission, but does not tell you the admission price. It is a great book when accompanied by another (like Lonely Planet or Rick Steves.)",neutral

Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters.

It might even inspire someone to but down his compound and pick up a real bow. This book is a compilation of accounts from Howards career that would be written off as fantasy if so many people hadn't witnessed what Howard was able to accomplish with a longbow.

This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge. Seligmann provides us a classified history of magic, beginning with ancient Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan and Greece; then shifts the main route towards the medieaval Europe. All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars.

Break Out the Coffee,"The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book, it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances, the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field, I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization, I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.",negative
3161453549,Homer or Moses?: Early Christian Interpretations of the History of Culture (Hermeneutische Untersuchungen zur Theologie),1.0,It was published. That's an accomplishment.,"First, this text is not the source of the interrelation between Mediterranean Sea cultures. Every book on Hellenistic kingdoms or the Roman Empire presupposes (or should) interrelation of cultures because those political boundaries encompassed a variety of cultures. (A ""specialist"" should know this.) This text is just what it says: a chronicle of Homer and Moses citings.Second, other authors have expounded on this topic: they have, and they will again. I'm not going to explain in depth here because to do so would be to give away my doctoral thesis. I don't particularly want to see someone else take my sources, present my argument, and have my book published under his/her name.Third, it is extremely difficult to write a doctoral thesis, from my experience. So, while I cannot say that it is the best work on the topic, I think we should have sympathy for doctoral student writers. It is publish or perish, after all. At least it was published. I can only hope for so much for myself.Whether or not you the reader purchase this book is a matter of your own choice. Having to go back to the library for it too often is an indication that one is using it as a reference and not looking to the original sources. That is ill-advised. (Of course, libraries are the friends of ""specialists."")

The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now.

Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation.",positive

It is so practical and really applies to any age of child/adult and parenting style. The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says ""You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it"" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings ""You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum"" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book!

It made me think about my spiritual values and what it must have been like for those who were trying to live with a commitment to living gently on the earth, not hurting wild creatures, not using leather.I appreciated the honesty as well - as varous people would talk of giving into corruption and sneaking Dr. Pepper soda on a trip to town and other acts that went against general group values. Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood. Others were in a state of transition.Ultimately, the Farm broke up but this book is a powerfl reminder of all that was good about it and of the yearning for finding new ways of building stronger community lives.

157067051X,Voices from the Farm: Adventures in Community Living,5.0,awesome book about group dynamics of any kind,"This book is a collection of oral histories and some original documents from the early days of the famous Farm commune in Tennessee. The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the ""mission creep"" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world.",positive

0887402216,The Battleship Bismarck,3.0,The Battleship Bismarck reviewed,"This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's ""Pursuit,"" published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, ""Seekriegsleitung"" gets translated as ""sea-war-leadership,"" which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term ""naval operations,"" which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research.",neutral

Some of his statements: There are unfortunately a great many people with attractive surface attitudes but with the same old rubbish underneath (9), If you fail to direct your subconscious mind, it produces under a law of averages, and you are a nice, ineffective sweet person (84), I call treatment mind surgery.

Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view.

Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won't welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn't expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won't be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas. Her secondary characters likewise sparkle, from the Lassiter family to the meddlesome sisters that live in the same apartment building as Alan and Prudence. Unexpectedly delightful, BY HONOR BOUND comes highly recommended.",positive

Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series.

She was taken under the care of a couple who oversaw the island, but they have died, and she is completely alone. One day, she finds that a young man is washed ashore, and drags him from the water. She does not want to be near him, as she was warned to stay away from all men, so she hides on the island. Colin Macpherson, a highlander, searches for the young lady who rescued him. Tess is stubborn, but eventually they get to know one another. Tess does not know much about her past, with the exception of nightmares which give small recollections. Colin realizes that Tess is part of the Lindsay clan, and when a ship comes to rescue him from the island, Tess goes with him, in order to find the life she was taken away from eleven years ago.

It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute. I would have loved to have seen how Tess and Colin's relationship matures as they do, but that is beyond the scope of this book and the age range it is intended for. I will probably be searching out McGoldrick's adult romance novels, though, given the promise this one held.",positive

Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book.

0781810698,Beginner's Yoruba (Hippocrene Beginner's Series),5.0,Great starting point,"This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as ""teacher"" but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first, they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book, which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher, though. All in all, it's a great set and, if mastered, can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator, who speaks English to announce the lessons, is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead!",positive

0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",4.0,Much more sensible than most books critical of the field.,"This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: ""Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)."" Or ""Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)."" Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover.",positive
0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",4.0,Fascinating and Terrifying,"Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can't figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don't agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care.",positive
0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",4.0,"Informative, but left me wanting more","I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn't say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did't give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don't suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine.",positive
0471192627,"A Dose of Sanity: Mind, Medicine, and Misdiagnosis",3.0,Somatic medicine as an alternative to psychiatry?,"Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM ""a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis.""The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only ""treatment"" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on ""bad parenting."" No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually ""incompetent, lazy, or bad."" He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the ""adult orphanage.""Those of you who are interested in ""alternative psychiatry"" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf",neutral

0312322291,King James: Believe the Hype---The LeBron James Story,4.0,King James Scores!,"Ryan Jones is a great basketball writer. In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, ""I don't want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was."" Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though ""there wasn't much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better."" Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike.

I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish.

B0006DWYDW,Building the timber frame house: The revival of a forgotten craft,4.0,Solid reference material for someone planning a build,I have somewhere over a dozen titles on timber frame construction. This is the one I keep referring back to when it comes to my own construction plans. It is not written as a commercial for the next timber frame workshop as many of these books are. It shows several different building and roof styles rather than a single one. Good detail on joints and joinery as well as planning figures are included.

B0006DWYDW,Building the timber frame house: The revival of a forgotten craft,5.0,Great Book...early work on Timber Framing,"This book is one of the classics on Timber Framing for those who want to get into this type of construction or build their own house. It is a very easy read. Though sometimes the author tends towards to much philosophy about life, construction and wood working.This book has very useful sections on joinery, design, raising, engineering, load physics, etc. Very easy to understand even if, like me, you are not a professional carpenter, contractor or mechanical engineer. I know nothing of contracting or building and understood the whole book.The book does not mention anything about Scribe Rule and Square Rule techniques and the differences between the two. These old techniques may not have been widely known when this book was written, although they were well known by early timber frame carpenters, before Timber Framing was replaced with cheaper, but faster Balloon Framing.A book that does go into Square Rule in a more structured way and is equally easy to read is Buid a Classic Timber-Framed House, by Jack Sobon.",positive

Focused too: nothing outside the scope of the *classic* timber frame.",positive
B0006DWYDW,Building the timber frame house: The revival of a forgotten craft,5.0,Nearly three decades old and more relevant than ever,"This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was ""green"" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term ""stick built"" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. ""Wood never lies to you."" ""You don't just hack away obliviously."" As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:""To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries.""Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a ""passivhaus"" or ""passive house"", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a ""green"" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8"" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes.",positive

The book discusses the best types of wood for pyrographic efforts and this was useful. The book has a wide variety of designs from birds to seashore items. All are well drawn. The disigns are complex, and they are printed in the book very lightly. The problem in reproducing them comes from the lightness of the picture and the complex design.

B0007DQIIS,"The ancient constitution and the feudal law,: A study of English historical thought in the seventeenth century",4.0,Interesting,"An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing.",positive

B000PHTCGG,Seance,5.0,Tales of the world I never knew and never will,"Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, ""The Seance"" and ""The Letter Writer"" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form.",positive
B000PHTCGG,Seance,5.0,Excellent - as good as it gets!,"Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!",positive
B000PHTCGG,Seance,3.0,Singer writes scary stories,"&#34;The Seance&#34; is a collection of short stories. It portrays the lives of Jewish characters in Eastern Europe between the wars.I found the book a little hard to read. Singer paints his characters so clearly, you can actually smell them. That is sometimes too hard to take. I saw my grandmother in his pictures and it wasn't to pleasant.",neutral
B000PHTCGG,Seance,4.0,Short stories that use Jewish peasant life to express notions of more universal import,"THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of ""Yanda"" is a provincial prostitute, while ""Zeitl and Rickel"" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a ""take a book, leave a book"" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable.",positive

I felt a lot less cynical and much more positive about the institution of marriage as a result of reading this book.I thought it was excellent and I feel it's a book that would probably appeal to many more people if the title was different.

It expands on the idea that just because you are part of a couple does not mean you have to give up yourself.

Everything from sex to doing the dishes is covered in this book. Some of the language may sound dated since it's original printing, but then again, so does Shakespeare.This the best book I have ever found to learn about ALL aspects of your marital relationships (not just the sexual ones) and discover the ways in which people try to control and eventually destroy each other as individuals within a marriage.If you want a book on ""swinging"" (a/k/a recreational, non-monogomous sex) then this is NOT the book you are looking for. But then again, Open Marriage is leaps and bounds beyond just swinging. This book guides you through making this a way of life in a wonderful way, changing the traditional marriage views in ALL aspects, including non-monogomous sex, but not JUST sex.How do I know this?

B0006D6DRK,"Open marriage;: A new life style for couples,",5.0,"title refers to open communication and self examination, not swinging","Please don't be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn't worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an ""open"" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum ""An unexamined life is not worth living"" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:""The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride.""One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in ""bitter disappointment"" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn't going well, and someone angrily threatened that ""we all had better start having fun right now!"" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental ""maps"" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine.",positive

Better books have been written, but haven't been hyped so thoroughly, so it keeps getting reprinted.The ""open marriage"" concept has -- REPEAT AFTER ME -- absolutely nothing to do with sexual nonmonogamy. Rather, the authors examine the problem of what another author has called ""the couple front,"" where couples feel they must act as if they're surgically joined, & end up feeling confined & eventually hating each other.If you are NOT interested in nonmonogamy, then read ANY book by Harville Hendrix & you'll find thoughts that are much more practical.If you ARE interested in nonmonogamy (group marriage, polyamory, etc.), then start with Intimate Friendships (Ramey), Polyamory (Ravenscroft -- whoops, that's me), Polyamory (Anapol), Honest Sex (Roy & Roy), or Group Marriage (Constantine & Constantine)... or even The New Faithful (Nearing), or Three in Love (Foster).I usually see ten copies of this book at any thrift store.

B0006D6DRK,"Open marriage;: A new life style for couples,",4.0,"Actually, some decent advice.","The criticisms of this book are mostly about its non-monogamous aspect: the O'Neills (allegedly) broke up, therefore their relationship style is null and void. By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is ""together until death"" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, ""open marriage"" back then didn't mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don't have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don't have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn't share. You don't have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don't make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about ""the grass is always greener"", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the ""love and sex without jealousy"" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren't very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a ""one and only way"" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the ""emotional infidelity"" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn't.",positive

It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree.

Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end).

Mary B. is sweet and loves her garden. Her other half is wicked to the max. The novel starts with her cussing like a sailor, wholly unlike sweet Mary B. The incredibly stupid atty. doesn't infer anything about the seeming two Mary's. Mary B. charged with murder that she obviously committed. Most of book contains court scenes that are well-written but are merely banal and static, the story stops. After conviction inevitable knife attack on atty by bad Mary, who we now learn is a twin of good Mary; at least that's the way the book reads. Within the reality of the book this is impossible and nonsense. But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality. But, no, the book is saying that there are two Maries...not one with a good and bad side. If you want to read a lot of fairly interesting courtroom questioning by prosecutor and def. atty, most of the book is irrelevantly devoted to this, so read it and enjoy an O.J. moment. Perhaps the worst mystery/suspense novel I have ever read. This is my fourth and last McBain novel.

B000FZEKVA,Communicating with Orcas - The Whales' Perspective,4.0,Orca Wisdom as told by Mary Getten,"Whales in the dreams of children, whale spirituality, whale sex and whale governance are all things we'll not likely get from scientific researchers for decades, perhaps a century or two. That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in ""Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective"". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:""I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: ""Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette.""Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: ""Can't you say anything but hello?""Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as ""The Prime Cause,"" are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson",positive

This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you.

And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in ""Freeing Keiko"" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so.",negative

1890951617,Academic Freedom after September 11,1.0,Dishonest,"Most of the authors of this book say, in effect, that they are accused of being anti-American. By right-wing fanatics! But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that ""pro-Israel lobbying groups"" and others are ""policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse."" Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers ""effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism."" That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's ""extracurricular"" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was ""disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."" But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that ""any criticism of Israel"" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote ""violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."" Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs ""the American Likud."" He says ""this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."" And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is ""false and brazenly bigoted."" It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards.",negative
0345340949,The Impatient Gardener's Lawn Book,4.0,"Pretty good, although a few flaws","This is, all-around, a pretty good lawn book. However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]",positive

Everyone left lost a family member, and mourning set upon the community.Needless to say, their lot was not easy, and most ultimately succumbed.This is a valuable testament to horrors suffered in the Holocaust by one community, horrors that were repeated in every other ghetto across Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and so on.Heartbreaking.--Alyssa A.

Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults.

1852309040,The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine: A Comprehensive System for Health and Fitness,5.0,The BEST introduction to Chinese Medicine on the market.,"My partner is a Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic ""anatomy"", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can't think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

B000H45MXO,THE SECULAR CITY -SECULARIZATION AND URBANIZATION IN THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,5.0,A profound if somewhat exaggerated analysis of 'global secularization',"How the world has changed since Harvey Cox argued that there is an inevitable and inexorable process of global secularization which is leading to a total separation of the political and religious. Cox's argument was that urbanization and secularization go together, and that they empty the world of mythic and traditional religious power.Today forty years after the publication of his book the world is in the midst of a global struggle in which the forces of Western democratic society are pitted against a radical Islamic revivalist fundamentalism. Moreover within the realms of other religions including Christianity there has been a kind of 'return to religion' which was certainly not dreamnt of in Cox analysis. He did not have a clue in regard to the Evangelical revival in the United States, and the prominent place it would come to play, ( Perhaps unprecedented place) in American politics.This does not make Cox's analysis wrong for his time. Nor was he mistaken in seeing the important trend to secularization. He only made the mistake most of us make of seeing the past and future of what seemed to him the predominant and irreversible trend of his time.But History and the development of Mankind have a way of surprising us all.As a footnote I would say that the one area of the world in which Cox analysis does seem to be largely correct today is Europe. 'Post-Christian Europe' however does not seem the apogee of human enlightentment , the wave of the future. Rather it seems more a declining island already invaded by those kind of 'religious forces it expelled as Christian and is receiving as Muslim'.Irony of ironies, that the very heart of the 'secular city' today seems as if it will in a matter of generations take a great fall into backwardness. But again this is an aside, and I would instead make the more general caveat, that no one should fall so readily into the underlying assumption of Cox's analysis i.e. that there is a predominant historical trend for the future which we can clearly discern.Wisdom and humility would suggest that we rely more on our powers of future observation than of extrapolation from the Past.",positive

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,BEST BOOK EVER!!,"This is 1 of da bst books dat i have EVER read! @ my school, we are doing a play on this & im playin Mary-Lynette. i cant wait 2 get to the last chapters when they finally give in 2 each other! Gr8 books!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,one of the best night world books!!!!,first of all i thought that this was one of lj smith's best books she has written adn also the funniest. i love all the characters but my fave one in the book is Ash. he's really a hottie and a babe i just love him 4 trying 2 be real. so far ash and thierry are my 2 most fave male characters in the night world series. anyways this book is about 3 sisters who are fugitives from the night world trying to live normal lives with humans but finding out that theyre brother Ash wants them back home. and meets up with mary- lynnette who turns out to be his soulmate but doesnt want it as much as she doesnt want it either. anyways i thought Ash was a much better character in daughters of darkness than in secret vampire i thought he acted like a jerk in the 1st night wortld book. it tells me that he has gotten better and that not all humans are bad to live by. i would love to have a guy like Ash for a bf. he's a total babe. funny 2. well g2g also if anyone is waiting for strange fate 2 come out it wont be coming out til 2004.,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,3.0,three sisters to die for.......,"Once started I couldn't put it down, literally. I didn't stop til I'd read it through.Three sisters on the run from the Night Worlds patriachal society, they visit Oregon. Their brother finds out where they are and tries to drag them back, except for a few minor details he has it all figured out. 1. someone else knows where the girls are and if Ash doesn't bring them back, Quinn will bring in the authorities. 2. Ash has found his soulmate Mary-Lynette who also knows their secret identity. 3. someone killed their aunt and they don't know who, is it a vampire hunter or someone who knows the truth.The vampires are in danger and Ash and Mary-Lynette have fallen in love. END",neutral
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,1.0,Disappointing to say the least,"This book is probably, in my opinion, one of (if not THE) worst in the Night World Series. It is Ash's story this time, who's soulmate just happens to be a human. (which Ironically was shadowed upon in the first book, 'Secret Vampire'.) Ash's character was cool, charismatic....and totally wasted in this book. Mary Lynnette was too self riteous, too...I don't know. To me, she didn't come off as the strong female lead she was supposed to. Instead, I found myself annoyed at her several times throughout the book. She was presumptuous, she was always assuming things, and she was rather stereotypic if you ask me. I think someone like Maggy from 'Black Dawn', or even someone like Hanna or Gillian from 'Soulmate' and 'Dark Angel' would have been a better match for Ash, not this smart alec, holier than thou woman named Mary Lynnette.The book itself was lacking as well. We pretty much learn nothing about the nightworld, it doesn't much progress the series except to mention a few characters that appear in future books. All in all, a disappointment. Ash's first appearance in 'Secret Vampire' stole the show, so when this book was released, I was ecstatic. 'Finally', I thought. 'Something that touches on Ash's past and personality. We will finally get to read his story.' Well, as it turned out, he was poorly underwritten. Or perhaps this particular book would have worked better if it had been a little later in the series, if Mary Lynnette wasn't so sharp tongued, if there weren't so many CHARACTERS to concentrate on. This wasn't so much Ash and M.L's story as it was all the sisters. Too many people to concentrate on. The three sisters should have been given their own book for character developement if that was the case. I would suggest this book only to those who wish to further their Night World series collection, or just their L.J Smith collection, in general. As for the enjoyment factor?...Nadda.",negative

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Excellent Book!!!!!!,"The plot, setting, mood and atmosphere in Daughters of Darkness was very potential. Ms. Smith developed the characters very well. The only improvement for this book should be the style and wording of the text. Even though L.J. Smith describes her characters well, she tends to repeat things more than necessary. It is good to remind the readers what a charater looks and acts like, but it seems that every other page she repeated the same thing or switched the characters in the content like she could not think of anything else to say.",positive

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,The Best of the Night World,"Though the plot is much like that of Pride and Prejudice, this book has a real feeling and flow that the rest of the Night World books can't compare with. There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn't go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,This is the all time best book!,"This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,It was good!!,I trust every girl is now inlove with Ash?? We ll I sure am cause he is gorgeous and his eyes......????? Heaven.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,This book is one of my favorates.,"I have read just about everything L.J. Smith has ever written. It all started when a friend of mine gave me The Strange Power- Vol. 1 of my favorate L.J. trilogy entitled Dark Visions and I loved it! I read everything I could get my hands on by her!! Before I discovered these books I never read anything due to sheer boredom. Now I feel that these books have helped me immensly! Anyway, I really should get on to my comments concerning the book. Daughters Of Darkness is really one of the best Night World books of all. It is sweet, suspenseful, and well written all in one great package. Unfortunetly, though these book literally melt my heart, I am afriad I will never find a man worthy of my all time favorate L.J. Smith badboys such as Ash(Daughters of Darkness), Gabriel(mmm.. oh! um Dark Visions), Nick(Secret Circle), and Quinn(short but sweet... from The Chosen). Oh well!! Anyhow read the books, people!! Then you'll know what I'm talking about!! OK!!???",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,My favorite of all her books!!!!!!!,"This is the best book L.J. has written, and I've read all seven (they're all good). I'm still waiting for Black Dawn to come out. Mary-Lynnette and Ash are so realistic, besides that he's a vampire. My favorite part is when Mare keeps kicking him in the shins. It's funny, because it also tells us (this is what I interpreted) that it doesn't matter what race you are, it matters whats on the inside. Afterall, like Jade says, &quot;You can't be soulmates with vermin!&quot",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Second Book in the Night World Series,"Set in Briar Creek, Oregon, ""Daughters of Darkness"" primarily follows 17-year-old Mary-Lynnette Carter, though the book is supposedly about her new neighbors, three vampire sisters: Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern. The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven't read any of the other books in this series and can't compare this one to the others, I really liked ""Daughters of Darkness."" It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,This book had me giggling,"I'm sorry, but I just find the way Mary Lennette treats Ash to be just hillarious. Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don't know, maybe the way I said it isn't that funny, but I thought it was hillarious. Ash is hillarious with his little side comments and he's simply a very interesting character. It took me awhile to get myself to finally buy it, but its definetly a good read.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Another awesome book from LJ Smith!,"Daughters of Darkness, the second book in LJ Smith's Night World series, is probably the best book in the series.Mary-Lynette is the intellectual heroine in this book. She's a human obsessed with astromomy who's stumbled across a strange, supernatural secret about the new girls next door. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are beautiful vampire sisters who have escaped from their strict home across the country. Mary Lynette and her brother, Mark, become quick friends with the sisters, but someone doesn't want them to live in harmony.And then there's the slight problem that the girls' brother, Ash (who appeared in the first Night World book, Secret Vampire), who has come to bring his sisters back. Ash is icy cold and ruthless, but Mary Lynette might just be the person to melt his heart.This book is so awesome that you won't want to put it down until you've finished. But I would definitely recommend reading the Night World series in order, since the characters reappear and the events link together, so if you haven't read Secret Vampire yet, do that first. But if you have, definitely read this book!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,THIS IS MY FAV BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!,"This is the best book out of the Night World series. At first, in the first book, u think Ash is the bad guy, but that opinion totally goes out the window when u read this book.(The same thing w/ Quinn, but that's another book) I have all the Night World books and love them all. I've read them all over and over, but this is my fav. I can totally relate w/ the feeling of longing Mary-Lynette felt at the beginning, and like her, I am looking for someone to share the night w/ (even though i know only a little about astronomy) Ash is definantly a character. He's strong-willed, and has a smart mouth, but is vulnerable like a hurt child underneath it all. There needs to be another book that continues the story of Ash, Mary-Lynette, Mark and the sisters. Ash had small parts in Dark Angel (when he got Gillian out of that club Angel lured her in) and in Soulmates (when he was in Circle Daybreak when he met Hannah and told her about his soulmate.) If you haven't read this one yet, it is a must read. I beleive in soulmates and it makes me wish for mine even more If only the Night World really existed . . . but oh well. I hope you bring in Mary-Lynette and Ash again, I would really like to know the outcome.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Mary Ash,Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,3.0,Quick and Fun,"As an adult reader I gave this a 3 star because some things were not very logical. The story was well written and as a teen I think I would have given it a 4 maybe even a 5. I would not mind letting my children read this book as the love relationships are based on emotions rather than physical appearance and pleasure. The relationship between the characters are healthy, for example they do not have the male stalking the female or the female saying she is going to die without the male. Yes that is a comparison to the Twilight series, but this series was written long before Twilight was thought of.The parts I did not find logical is the fact the vampire girls were not going to use any of the powers in the new town they moved too. Why not? I get that they did not want to kill their food (people) but why not talk to each other telepathically. What is the point of not doing that? No one would have known they were doing that. Vampires are stronger than people and one girl had a hard time doing a task a human could do without a problem. Another thing that bothered me about this book is Poppy and James are not in this book. There was a thought of them for a second but I would have liked something to let me know how they were doing. Is Poppy still an illegal vampire? Did her dad except them and her living dead situation? I mean so many unanswered questions.",neutral
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,1.0,Night World 2: Daughters of Darkness,"Night World #2: Daughters of Darkness, by L. J. SmithFor me, ""Daughters of Darkness"" is the one sour note in Smith's Night World series. It was the one book in the nine book series that I had to force myself to finish (I am obsessive about finishing everything I read).The concept is interesting, but I feel it could have used better execution. As with all Night World books, the protagonist is female. Mary-Lynette is a human and unaware of the secret world of vampires, werewolves, and other spooky things that exist around her. She thinks she lives in the quietest, most boring town in the world, but that's all about to change when a series of startling events happens.When the next door neighbor goes missing just as her three nieces arrive in town, and Mary-Lynette sees them burying something in the backyard, she's immediately suspicious. Unable to leave the mystery alone, she heads next door and meets the new arrivals, who further her apprehension about the disappearance of her neighbor. The girls remind her of predators, which is unsurprising as the girls are lamia, or born vampires.The mystery of who killed the neighbor takes up a good chunk of the book, and in my opinion, is very over used. It just drags on too long, and every time there was a new twist in the whodunit, I kept thinking, ""Okay, that's the end of it now...no, wait...there's more. Sigh.""Ash Redfern also makes an appearance in this book (some readers may remember him from ""Night World #1: Secret Vampire,"" where he waylaid Poppy), and is a starring character along with his sisters. Initially he's on the hunt for the three sisters, who ran away from a vampire enclave. Ash is characterized as the ultimate vampire - humans are vermin and nothing more, to him. Mary-Lynette takes an immediate dislike to him when meeting him for the first time. And here's where the potentially interesting concept comes in - Ash and Mary-Lynette are soulmates, but unlike Smith's other couples, the two can't stand each other.But something about this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the overly drawn out murder mystery. Or maybe it was that the main character, Mary-Lynette, seemed dry. Or maybe even what seemed interesting - soulmates disliking each other - somehow doesn't fit in a series that's about finding your soulmate.1/5.",negative

I thought it was really different how Mary-Lynette and Ash tried to ignore the fact that they were soulmates, and it made the story much more interesting to read. Personally, I never would have guessed that it was Jeremy who had killed the girls aunt 'cause he seemed like a relly nice guy, but I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. I really wish that there was a sequel to this book 'cause I really want to find out what happens with Ash and Mary-Lynette.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Wow! L.J. Smith is definitely my new favorite author!,"I loved this book so much! I couldn't put it down for a minute. I've read almost all of the Nightworld series, but this by far is the best. The humor and the romance that brings Ash and Mary-Lynette together is great. The ending was kind of sad though. I would definitely read any sequels to this book. I hope that there is one. For those people who think the soulmate principle is getting old, I disagree.

I liked the rivalry between Ash and Jeremy, but don't think it should really be that severe. How could the two races get along, even if the vamps were more powerful, or the wolves are stupid? I have to admit the only corny part is the fact that the two pairs of soulmates are related. I just really liked this book, and think it is the best yet. I do want to see what happens to all of them later on, like say at the begining of the the battle to save the world. I just want to come back to see that Mary-Linnette and Mark are vamps, etc.",positive

I like the way she mixes both of them together without going overboard. She is my favorite author but I really wish that she could make her books come out monthly.And I wish that she could include other stories besides the soulmate principal. Like maybe a vampire killer as the main character.A totally wicked character that loves to kill. Maybe she could bring us what she feels goes through a killer's mind. There's a lot of other ways she could make us love her books,maybe if she described the NIGHT WORLD more. Maybe stopping and making the females a lot stronger instead of pitiful weaklings.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Read it for ASH,I totally love Ash...but as for the rest of the book..it was ok...there was a false clue in the book about who the bad guy really was...the one about the short blunt sticks...and also the whole vampire thing sounded like a wannabe christopher pike thing...especially the whole idea about &quot;forgetting&quot;...anyway...i love ash and i'd definitely read it again just to read about his character...i love all these misunderstood guys...,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,great book though not the very best!!! =,i really liked this book although it's only the second nightworld book i've read... it is really interesting and it's definitely worth reading!!!i'm wondering why it's so hard to find this series in Singapore.,positive

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,I loved this book!,"This book was so amazing! Mary-Lynnette is a character who I can really relate to, myself being obssessed with astronomy also.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,My Favorite So Far,I love Lisa Jane Smith's books! I especially like the way she carries the soulmate principle throughout all of the &quot;Night World&quot; series. I really liked this book and I think anyone who reads it will too.,positive

Once you pick it up you can't put it down.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,3.0,weird!,"It was a good book. But the thing I don't understand is how Mary-Lynnette and Mark drank Kestral, Jade and Rowan's blood while being human. Yecch!. On top of that the blood tasted sweet and smelled like Vanilla. Gimme a break!",neutral
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Remarkable.,"I loved the action part!! Also, sometimes I wished Mary-Lynette could just embrace the fact that she loves Ash! I could fall in love with Ash myself! haha!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Night World - Book Two,"Daughters of DarknessL.J. Smith1996I continue to be surprised by how overally well-written the ""Night World"" books are, collectively. For young people in particular, they are quality fiction.Three young female vampires come to tiny Briar Creek, Oregon, to live with their also-vampire elderly aunt, but homicide is the word of the day, and curious neighbors Mark and Mary-Lynette quickly find themselves ensconced in the dangerous waters of the Night World -- and the even more unpredictable currents of love.I didn't quite like ""Daughters"" as much as ""Secret Vampire"", the first book in the series. The tale had a bit less... urgency... than its predecessor, and while I did like the redemption of Ash, bad-boy blonde from the first novel, the character development was again a little underexplored. But the world-building is pleasant and well-done, without info-dumping on young readers with potentially short attention spans.Again I can't help but wonder what a greater length could have done for the series -- ""Daughters' ""plot is a bit simplistic. The ending felt... unsatisfying.But without doubt worth a read, as I will wager the entire series will be.6.8/10",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Soul-mates,"I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Possibly the Best out of this series!,"It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Amazing!,LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance.

I was happy to see Ash return and a lot of charecter development happen to him. He's now one of my favriote charecters. And Mary-Lynette is definatly a strong Female charecter! If your looking for some twisted Night World romance this is the book to read. It's full of vampires and magic unlike ever before!",positive

Smith's bookswith Vampire Diaries, but this book puts itself at the top of my listof cool books. Most of the appeal is in the way Mary-Lynette treats Ash Redfern. At first she REALLY doesn't like him, but after a while she realizes he's her soulmate, though their relationship doesn't magically become all right.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,This book is the best of all times!,"I think this book is one of the greatest of all times! I havn't read any other L.J.

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Daughters of darkness the best of night world,i think that this is probebly to me the best night world book i have read. My favourite characters were probebly Kestral and Ash but they were all really good characters. i think this book is a brilliont read and recomend it to any one its kind of a romantic horror. I really enjoyed this book it was the first night world book i read and now i'm hooked so if you buy the book i hope you enjoy it.,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,One of the best books I've ever read!,"DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,The BEST book of the Night World series!!!!!,This book was great and I just loved Ash. It should have 5 stars from everyone. And you have to read it. It was great. I did not like what happened to Jeremy but it was still the best book in the Night World series! It keeps you reading to the end. You will not put it down. I hope you read it for your sake. So read it!!,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,best of the Night World books,"Jade, Kestrel, and Rowan, three vampire sisters, have left their home in secrecy. Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt. Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it. Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back. Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash. Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book. It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity). This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond. I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers. Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn't just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot. The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn't really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says. This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,"Daughters of Darkness, a love story in a supernatural series","Personally, I feel this book is the best in the Night World series, because I love the character Ash. He is such a hottie, though he has many personality flaws and actions to be ashamed of. That just makes him a more realistic character. Mary-Lynette and the rest of the characters are well thought-out also, and I hope to read about them in the future. This is my favorite series of L.J. Smith's, because in incorporates all creatures of the night. I look forward to reading Huntress and Black Dawn, since I've read all the other Night World books numerous times already, to indulge my fantasy craving mind. My only disappointment is that there are no shapeshifter soulmates. They must be just as intriguing as witches and vampires. And why can't I find Volume one of the Vampire Diaries anywhere? That series must be out of print, though it isn't old",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,3.0,"Murder, mystery, werewolves, vampire and soulmates","Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).",neutral
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Worth a read,"Book 2 of the Night World series, Daughters of Darkness, shifts focus to a new set of characters of the secret society. Relatives of James from the first book, we meet Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade. They are three vampire sisters who snuck away from home. Tired of the secret society, they want to try to live as humans out in Oregon. They move into a dilapidated old home, next to Mark and Mary-Lynette Carter. As Jade and Mark get closer, their brother Ash comes to town to bring his sisters back. Of course, he meets Mary-Lynette and things get interesting...Ash, the handsome blondie who we remember from the first book as being a conniving, selfish, and manipulative, experiences a bit of growth in this book. In the first book you would have never thought it would happen, but I was glad to see the character development.What I like about the Night World books is that while you could read each book separately as a stand-alone, it's great to see prior plot lines and character weaved into the current story. It makes you feel even more connected to the story and the world.These books are short reads, but I find them pretty satisfying because the plot moves along and it focuses on what you really want to see.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Vampires And Mystery? You'd Be Surprised,"Mary-Lynnette's wants seem simple enough. She likes her quiet life, stargazes as a hobby, bases her life around becoming an astronomer, and hopes the three new girls moving in next door with the kindly, if eccentric, Mrs. Burdock will help to bring her shy brother, Mark, out of his shell.Unfortunately, what she ends up with is a murder mystery, romance she doesn't want, and oh, yeah, those three new girls are vampires with a dangerous older brother coming to drag them back home.There are a LOT of characters to focus on, as per usual with a murder mystery. We have Mary-Lynnette, Mark, the three sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade, their brother Ash, and the local werewolf, Jeremy. And those aren't even the suspects. The endless supply of characters in such a short amount of pages is a little overwhelming, with so many aspects of so many characters not fully explored. But what really gets the reader, even the fans of over ten years, is the star-crossed attraction between Mary-Lynnette and Ash.It's a bumpy road, to put it lightly. Mary-Lynnette is a simple, if nosy, human girl, while Ash is a dangerous, well-known vampire--and not well-known in the good sense, in Mary-Lynnette's book. Understandable; in Secret Vampire and Daughters of Darkness it's implied he's killed human girls and worse. There are very subtle hints at sexual abuse toward human females that younger readers may miss, but the words are enough to paint a picture that Ash is Very Bad.Many fans complain at the ending, but it is the ending that keeps them so captivated with these two. Mary-Lynnette wants to finish high school. She can't see herself with Ash as he is now, knowing his past. Ash is sorry and wants to repent, by the end of the novel, but wanting isn't enough. Mary-Lynnette is dealing with a soulmate who is potentially mentally unstable, definitely cruel, and by all human means, a classified felon (if he could be traced, that is).L.J. Smith did well in ending the story with no conclusion (which she has promised the fans would come at the end of the series for years; ten years later and still nothing). Ash needs room to grow in order to be someone Mary-Lynnette will not regret willingly falling in love with.This is a good book, by no means the best, but excellent for the series. It was the second book I read (no, Secret Vampire was not the first) and ultimately the one that got me hooked.Here's to hoping the Mary-Lynnette/Ash fans get closure in the near future. Publishers, don't keep faithful fans in suspense!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,"Excellent, one of the best","I, LOVE this book. It is by far the best of L.J.Smiths Night World books. I can only find one flaw. No-one, and i mean no-one would just let a hunky guy like Ash just walk away? I mean Come On! As if. OK so what he's done some bad things but hey, you'll get over it. What if something happens to him while he's away and the last thing you said was ""nice line"". But okay that's fine, you wanna let him go? OK. But when do we get to find out if and when he and Mary Lynette get back together? That's just mean not telling us that. But besides that downfall the book was excellent and I love the way L.J.Smith described how they all turned really beautiful after they had fed. Heeheehee.Neways gotta go, hope you all enjoy/d the book as much as I did.Jess",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,My favorite Night World book!,"This is my favorite book in L.J. Smith's uniformly excellent Night World Series. I've read it about a million times, and it never gets tired. I love the romance between Mary Lynette and Ash. The idea of soulmates is very exciting, and the scenes between the two of them are perfect. My favorite part is when Mary Lynette quotes Pride and Prejudice and Ash responds the same way, shocking her. Sigh. If you haven't read this book, get thee to a bookstore, a library, whatever and start right away!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,One of my favourites,"In Daughters of Darkness, LJ Smith outdoes herself. Three beautiful sisters hide a deadly secret that threatens to be discovered by the inhabitants of a sleepy town. Rowan, Kestrel and Jade are on the run - from their families and from the Elders. They know that their brother Ash (James' cousin from Secret Vampire) is seeking them and that he is bent on returning them to the boring life they have led.Two siblings chance upon their secret and find themselves befriending vampires. As they learn more about the Night World, their own lives are turned upside down by a sickening deed. Who or what is it that stalks Briar Creek?Fantastic! I enjoyed this book immensely with its portrayal of two very different and yet similar families. The obvious difference is the species but the vampire girls have never had true freedom before while Mary-Lynette and Mark have lived their lives in a small town in the country. The similarities lie in the older sisters. Both fiercely protective of their siblings, they will do anything to keep them from harm.I loved the conflict between Ash and M'Lin, especially when they first meet. The story progressed well and unlike some stories, had a more convincing ending, rather than the sudden death of the baddie. This was one of my favourites in the series and I am still waiting anxiously for Strange Fate, which is the 10th.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST,"I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,The best book in the &quot;Night World&quot; Series,"Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Daughters of Darkness: A must read,"This second book in the Night World series does not compare with the first, but is good in it's own right. The three sisters are intriguing, and Ash, who was introduced in the first book, does a turnabout and becomes a guy any girl would want to marry. Overall, this book was very good, and for the vampire lover, a must read",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Another Triumph,"Compared to the rest of the Nightworld Series it's on a par with The Chosen, that's to say it's good but it's no Witchlight. The best thing about this one is that it centres around everyone's favourite Bad Boy Ash. His soulmate seems like a bit of a weakling at first but you'll soon warm to her.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,One of her best in the Night World series!,"Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Greatgreatgreatgreatgreat,"STARNGE FATE come out already! i've been waiting for this book for like a millenium.! oh yah, where was i? DOD is a superb book and i really loved Ash and ML. they are two drastically different characters except for their love for the night and as ML says, &quot;basically incompatible with each other...&quot;! well, i agree with that . they're even dif. in terms of looks and thinking. one black one white. no wonder there is so much problems circling this pair of soulmates. even on the net, i notice most of the fanfics are about ML and Ash and their *swoon* neverending love for ach other. however, they are AWFULLY insecure bout each other. i really hope Ms. Smith will write a book about them to clear up the loose ends........... well, not a boo maybe. but a loong part in a book to let us know the final of this love tragedy? *HOPEFUL*",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,It is the best book in the series.,"This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,If you're into vampire and romance you should read this book,"You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,great,this is one of my faviotites from the night wolrd series. i luv all of l.j. smiths books. they have a ceartin twist that sets them apart from all the other books neweyz...Ash hates humans he thinks their vermin and he is loooking for his three sisters that ran away from the night world...his three sisters(not human either) went to live with there grandmother only to find she is dead and when they bury her secretly some one is watching...a human saw them and can not believe her eyes but her brother(also human) thinks she is imagening things....and they come togher to try to find out who killed the grandma but at a very high priceits a very good book i recommened it! 8P,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,3.0,It was ok,"I thought Kestrel was pretty cool, but overall, this book was definitely NOT one of LJ's best. HELLO!!! HOw could pretty much everyone here rate this book 9-10???? It was NOT THAT GOOD. My reason is because MARY-LYNETTE S****D&gt; she was another one of LJ's cheesy perfect charactesr and the fact taht she ended up with the vampire hottie was blah, too predictable. It was way too &quot;Happy Ending&quot; for me.",neutral

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,READ IT READ IT READ IT!,"This book is incredible. It had me hooked from the very beginning. Why does everyone always say that they're in love with Ash? He's a great character, but not perfect in any way. Okay, ehough chit-chat. Read this book, I am serious. Rowan (my favorite!), Kestral, Jade, and Mary-Lynnette are just about the strongest female characters I have read in some time. I can find no flaw in any part of this book, and if you haven't already, READ IT!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,This book was d'bom,This is like the best book of the whole Night World series. I've read all of them and L. J. Smith is one great author. This is my total fave of the series cuz I just luv Ash. He has to be the hottest soulmate out of the whole series followed by Thierry. There just has to be another book with Ash and Mary-Lynette. If I were her I would definitely go with Ash. Mary-Lynette and Ash are perfect for each other both are so lonely and like the stars.,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Awesome,"This was one of the best in the whole Night World series, in my opinion. It was interesting, and kept you hooked until the very last page! I hope LJS writes more just like this one!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Awsome!,I loved this book. It was hard to put down. Ash has a weird attitude and is into nepotism but gets out of the habit. In secret Vampire he was sort of more into himself and kind-of portrayed as the relitive that you wish you never had. But in this book he mends his ways. I really recommend this book and the rest of the series. Gurgi,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,Ash rocks my world!,"In Secret Vampire you think of Ash as the villian but in Daughters of Darkness you find out that you're way wrong. He is simply a little too self absorbed... but he is very, very, funny. You want to smack Mary Lyynete for not going with. I also liked Jade the twit, Kestrel the fierce, and Rowan the wise. An excelant read.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,I absolutely LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love all her books every single solitary series! This was the first of her books I have ever read and it got me hooked i am buying it as soon as I can to add to my collection (I almost stole it from the library!) There has too be a sequal just to see waht happens (I have read other NW books but all it has is him mopeing everywhere trying to be good not evil) IT IS THE BEST IF YOU DONT OWN IT GET IT ASAP LIKE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Very Funny heeheehee,"This is the funniest Night World book. Ash is just so funny and has really werid things t2 say, def. the weridest night world person around. If anything, you've got 2 read it 4 Ash.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,2 Humans and 3 vampires after a vampire slayer,"I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of read it about 50 times, really! It's such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times! But it didn't really explain how Jeramey got there. How would he how where they were going?",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,the best!,"This book is my favorite one. I've read it eight times. All of L.J. Smith's books are fantastic; she's my absolute favorite writer. Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,A love story for haters of love and romance,"Thought you would never ever fall in love? So did the hero (if you can call him that) of this story. Ash doesn't particularly like the idea of having to chase his little sisters across the country after they ran away from home. And when he finds them he doesn't exactly love the idea that they have also told humans about the Night World, a secret society of the supernatural. Or the idea that his youngest sister is in love with a human. But what's worse is Ash's soulmate is a smart, beautiful human from a hick town who hates him and everything he stands for. Also, what's worse, his great-aunt is killed with a stake meaning that somebody knew she was a vampire. All this adds up to the worst thing that can happen to a teenage boy who wants to prove that he hates humans, loves fast cars and even faster girls. This is the funniest, most ludicrous book you could ever expect to read from L.J.Smith. The characters are SOO familiar, you might expect to see them in school the next day. A must read for readers of all ages and COMEDY CENTRAL lovers.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,THE ABSOUITE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"L J really outdid herself this time, this was undoubtedly one of the best books she has ever written. if you dont have this book, or don't like it, there is something serouisly wrong with your head, and you need to go see a doctor ASAP!!! I love the part where Ash and Beth are walking in the woods. What they both say and do are and is soooooo roamanitic. I always wish that the night world were real!! I wish I could have a vampire soulmate, the idea of becoming a vampire is really cool, i would love to become one. I don't know whats wrong with Beath!! You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books. And hey, if u know any of her fan club addresses, e-mail me. I only just discovered the wonder that is LJ Smith. I only have 4 of her books, but am ordering the rest soon. THANK Y O U ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive

SMITH should make movies out of these books.I would spend any amount of money to see them.My best friend is so in love with Ash.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,These are the most amazing characters!,"Why can't there be guys like Nick, Julian, Gabriel and especially Ash? I am so in love with all of them!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,The best of the Night World books,"Why can't Ash be real? I am so in love with him. I think L.J. Smith should stop writing the Night World series. Its watered down. The only really good book was Daughters of Darkness (the Chosen was good too) I think she should stick to triologies, so we can become really attached to those characters, i.e. Julian (still not over his death) Gabriel, Nick, and Stefan. Read all of her trilogies...even better than all her Night World stuff.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Tha BOMB of a book!!,"L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,I'm hooked and I want some more ...,"I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,L.J. Smith has so many correct details....,"I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,To cool,This book is exciting It's a turn pager you can't put it down.You think one thing will happen yet it does'nt. I think Smith did a wonderful job on this,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Lisa Jane Smith does it again! (YEAH!),"Ash. Ahh. Such a great guy. Mary-Lynette, she's a little wary(At first) and then at the end loves him passionatly. Can't blame her. Quinn sends him to bring back Ash's 3 sisters. Mark, Mary's younger brother, falls in love with Jade. She's one of the sisters along with her two older ones, Rowan and Kestrel. I'm sure you'll love it. I did",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,WOW!!!!!!!!,"We've fallen head over heels in love with Ash! I wish he was real, minus his feeding habits. Possibly the best book that we have read, and definitely the best Night World book so far! Every morning we check in the mirror for any signs of fangs. So far, none have appeared. Unfortunately. If anyone knows the way to join the Night World, let us know! We're DYING to be part of it. Literally. If you don't read it, then we're sending Ash after you!

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,I just love this book!,"Not only is this an amazing book, I believe it is the best book in the series that I have read so far. I am a huge admirer of L. J. Smith, and I can't wait until &quot;Huntress&quot; comes out. I just started reading her books last summer. I have since then tried to read all her books and recruit my friends to get hooked. Ash and Mary-Lynnette are extremely convincing characters, as are all the characters from the book. You can really see Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade from Lisa J.'s descriptions. You can totally understand the characters, and can almost believe they are real! READ THIS BOOK",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Read this book!,"In my opinion, Daughters of Darkness is one of the better Night World books. I have read all of them that have been published as yet, and I am an avid fan of the whole series. Great book",positive

Every Night World book iz very qool.I've read everyone of them at least 20 times each, and i own every one of 'em. of and for you people who think L.J.Smith is a guy, SHE isn't. Her name is Lisa Jane Smith. I suggest you go out and read every one of her books",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,You can't put it down!,L.J. Smith is a fantastic writer. In her Night World series second book&quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; deals with Vampires and Werewolves. So those of you who are into the supernatural stuff I recommend this book,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,"Vampires and Witches, oh yes!","I have been a fan of L.J. Smith ever since book one of _The Vampire Diaries_. With each of her books you can honestly BELIEVE that what she is writing about is the truth, even if the characters are ficticious. Dughters of Darkness (as well as any Night World book or the Vampire Diaries trilogy) should be required reading for anyone who believes in Vampires (or thinks they are one *grin*). Happy reading",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,This book rules!!!,"I loved this book. I liked the story line, and loved the characters. Ash is my favorite out of all the Night World characters! He rules. If you haven't read this book yet, you HAVE to. -Kat",positive

0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,I loved this book!!!,"When I read Secret Vampire I thought that Ash was evil and cruel..he actually reminds me of Julian (The Forbidden Game), but then when I read this book I loved him!! It showed a different side of him. I read all of the other nighworld books 1-9 but they didn't say much about what happens to Ash and Mary-Lynnette, I wish L J smith would write another book involving them..but anyway it was great...one of my favorites!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,It was great!!!,I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night.,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,I love this book!,i HAVE READ ALL of l.j.smith books from the secert circle to the last nightworld book and I must say I love this book because she has strong female lead charcters .

I fell in love with Ash, and I loved how Mary-Lynette and Ash acted when they were together. I kept cracking up over some of the stuff that they said when they were arguing. Plus, i really think Mary-Lynette should have become a vampire!!! Oh and one more thing. I LOVE ASH!",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,It really made you think...,"It was a terriffic book. Ash found a soulmate, Jade found a soulmate, I only wish that Mary-Lynnete had become a vampire (or the vampires could stay there)and that Jeremy hadn't been killed.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,EXCELLENT!!!,"This was the first book of the nightworld series I have read, from that moment on I was hooked. L.J Smith would have to be the best writer ever. Ash in the first book is kind of a jerk, but in this one you just can't help but like him.If you loved this book as much as I did you will love the chosen and huntress(also amongst my fave).",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,a great read,"I loved this book! It is one of the best vampire books I have read. It starts out when Rowen, Kestrel, and Jade move into their aunts house. Mark and Mary-Lynette live next door and want to know what is going on when they hear Aunt Opal just decides to go on vacation. I think Ash sounds like a nice guy. I hate books in which the vampires are the bad guys!I recommend all the books by L. J. Smith, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and Tamora Pierce.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,I loved this book!!!,"I've read all of the Night World books, and this is my absolute favorite!!! A must read for any LJ Smith fans!!!",positive

Then, when he shakes hands with Mary-Lynette, he finds his soulmate, a human, which he called vermin. He wants her more than anything, and he wont leave her. He asks her if she wants to become a vampire, to go with him, but she says no. The vampires aunt had been staked when they arrived, and then a staked goat shows up on their front porch. Who staked them? Is it a vampire hunter or a vampire? Will Mary-Lynette go with Ash? Or had destiny made a mistake making them soulmates?This is a wonderful book. I couldnt believe who it was that was the killer. The ending I couldnt believe either.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,i love LJ Smith!,I just love L.J. Smith! well her books. Anyways Ash is my favorite character and i love this book. it's really funny how Mary-Lynnette and Ash hate each other. and i was thinking has anyone noticed that Ash turns up for a little bit in almost every night world book? i can't imagine that LJS wouldn't conclude their relationship and maybe ash has a bigger part in this whole thing than we think. if anyone has any ideas about it e-mail me.,positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,Smith at her best! What more can be said!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book left me in tears for days!!!! I loved it!!! Ash is well what can I saw but that he is the Best character Smith has created( next to Julien in the Forbidden Games Seris) Mary Lynette is realistic and easy to relate to. Her bravery towards the cat like ash blond boy is amusing and gives the story a great twist. Reluctant lovers. This book has humor, suspense, and a bit of a murder mystery. Oh yah and a pincushion goat. What more could you want. Oh yeah , I'll mention Ash again! ( ohh and I have to say that the covers of the Night world seris in Europe do the book much more justice!!!)",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,4.0,I love the story!,"I admit, the story was great. But it was also tiring. I think it needs more description about the surroundings, and the characters. I admit, it's nice to have little soulmates wandering the world blissfully, but I was really glad that in this book, it wasn't the case. But despite that nice turn of events, it does not change the fact that, well, this book tends to asume everyone likes happy endings full of love. Those endings are great, but I felt this one could have used a twist, or unusual ending. Instead of the evil vampire being reformed and changed, maybe he should leave in a rage or something like that However, I still hope you'll read it, after all, it is entertainment.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,BEST LJS BOOK!!!!!!,"This is my favoret LJS book! I just love Ash and Mary- Lynnette's relationship. They are soulmates, yet hate it. It is so funny how they handle this situation. I hope Smith will write more about them in the up- coming NW books.",positive
0671551345,Night World: Daughters Of Darkness,5.0,You gotta read this book!,"I loved reading this book, it was so awesome. All of Lisa Jane Smith's books are.

I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart.

I think it was Ash that did it. He's so amazingly wonderful! (Along with Gabriel, Quinn, and Julian.) L.J. Smith is a terrific writer, and all of her books have good character development and description (especially of the guys). Not to mention that this book was hilarious at times. I was cracking up during Mary-Lynnette's encounters with Ash. And to think, I almost didn't read this book after I took it out of the library! It's a good thing I had nothing to do that day! Read it, and any other L.J. Smith book you can get your hands on! -LEX",positive
0330336681,The Sunday Telegraph 3rd Book of Nonograms,5.0,Great puzzles,These puzzles are also called &quot;paint by Number&quot; in the Games magazines. They are totally captivating. The paper could be a little stronger as I have to erase a lot. I have not found a single error in the book and I'm almost finished with it.,positive
0330336681,The Sunday Telegraph 3rd Book of Nonograms,2.0,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead.",negative
0330336681,The Sunday Telegraph 3rd Book of Nonograms,2.0,"Great puzzles, bad format","I really enjoy doing the type of puzzles in this book, but I've come to realize that having them in a large-format book with wire binding is an absolute necessity. All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper.",negative
0330336681,The Sunday Telegraph 3rd Book of Nonograms,4.0,Fun little book of puzzles,"For those who are fans of 'Paint by Numbers,' a puzzle that has taken the world by storm over the past decade, this book doesn't disappoint. Filled with lots of different art puzzles with the simplest of clues (a series of numbers), the final result never ceases to astonish.The one nit-pick I have is that the book is small, meaning the puzzles don't get that big either. As the puzzle has grown in popularity, so has the size of the puzzle, creating a more challenging atmosphere. These puzzles, by comparison, feel more like a beginner's version. But they're still fun and the results are, as usual, cool.",positive
1597400602,America at 1750: A Social Portrait,5.0,A superb snapshot of Colonial America up to 1750.,"The brilliant historian Richard Hofstadter was working on this book when he died in 1970. In eight highly readable chapters he presents clear discussions of several areas of Colonial America, among them: the explosion in population, the diverse ethnicity, the world of white indentured servents, black slavery and its trade, along with a discussion of the predominant middle class life many enjoyed, and finishes with three fine chapters on Colonial religion and the Great Awakening. His mastery of his subject matter and the clarity of his writing is a joy. The Scotch-Irish, the German religious sects who were excellent farmers, the terrified blacks kidnapped and marched 550 miles to the coast and into slavery, the desperate white indentured servents selling themselves into virtual slavery for a time, the always extremely dangerous ocean crossings, the greedy-yet terrified slaveholders and the cruel slave codes they wrote, the relatively prosperous Americans, the coming of G! ! eorge Whitefield--America's most spectacular preacher, the religious schisms that the Great Awakening brought: all these stories are here. And all packed into a highly readable book. A pleasure to read. Thank you Professor Hofstadter.",positive
1597400602,America at 1750: A Social Portrait,5.0,a sadly incomplete yet fully realized work,"This is a magnificent work of historical imagination. Hofstadter's last book, it was what was to begin a much larger, possibly three volume epic on the social conditions of America at distinctive periods in our history. And while this book is missing the fuller vision of a more articulated society, the chapters that are present are truly alive with insight and understanding of the way things probably were. Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can't help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing).",positive
1597400602,America at 1750: A Social Portrait,5.0,mirroring the reader,"I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece.",positive
1597400602,America at 1750: A Social Portrait,5.0,An Enlightening Step in All Americans' Past,"One of History's saddest events, I mean in the discipline of History, was the premature death of Richard Hofstader.With this book, the last he wrote, not finishing it, he also was making a turn in his writing career. Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was ""God,"" now it is sometimes ""God"" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self.",positive
1597400602,America at 1750: A Social Portrait,4.0,Time again to read the liberal idea of America,"AMERICA AT 1750: A Social Portrait, by Richard Hofstadter. 293 pages. Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: ""Anti-intellectualism in American Life"": ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays""; ""Social Darwinism in American Thought""; ""The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States.""When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as ""America at 1750"" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in ""The Middle Class World.""One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren't even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start.",positive

This book really does pack a lot of information into it for you, and it breaks up the monotony of facts and locations by throwing in little stories, examples, and quotes, which give history a little more ""personal"" feeling.

I'm new to Chicago, and I want to find the places to go off the beaten path.I wish I had skimmed the book before I bought it. In this book, the author reviews places he feels one needs to see. Review after review of restaurants and clubs and stores, the author used descriptions like, ""decent"" and ""nondescript."" In one review, he claims he is ""a tad ambivalent"" about that specific restaurant, and in another, he reviews a bar as being the sort that ""you never want to go to but find yourself in anyway."" Even the places he talked about positively, he never got excited about them. The most you'll get is a restaurant that serves food that is ""quite good."" He spends a good chunk of the book talking about how he is an ""old man"" now, and talks about things he did when he was young and what the neighborhoods of Chicago were like years ago, and in many of his reviews he admits that he hasn't been to that place in some time. This is fine if that's what you are looking for, but I would recommend a book on Chicago history if that's the case. The last straw was a review of a resale shop that ACTUALLY starts out with, ""Nothing special."" Why include this in your book of places ""you want to know about"" if it is nothing special?

I want to know why that symbolizes in the story, what is the author trying to describe or proof to the reader?I think this is a book quite dangerous for parents to read for their kids at bedtime, unless you go further in describing them the history and cross-meanings of the book--perhaps that is complete package of the book, and what the author want every parent or teacher to do.",neutral

0891010947,The Civil War Recollections of General Ellis Spear,5.0,First-Rate Recollections of the Civil War,"John J. Pullen, in his seminal work ""The Twentieth Maine"" describes Ellis Spear as a determined man with a dry sense of humor, the kind to ""take the convervative view of men and events."" Ellis Spear, a schoolteacher prior to the war, joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant in 1862. He would over the course of the Civil War rise to the commissioned rank of Colonel and the brevet rank of Brigadier General, a remarkable performance for a man with no prior military training. His duties with the 20th Maine would take him everywhere the Union Army of the Potomac traveled from late 1862 through Appomattox in 1865. As a Major, Spear was often the day-to-day commander of the 20th after August 1863.The 20th Maine is rather more famous than most volunteer regiments, thanks to its heroic fight on Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettyburg, a stand dramatized by Jeff Shaara in the novel ""Killer Angels"" and in the movie ""Gettysburg."" Spear's recollection of that day varies in the details from the traditional account presented by Pullen but this probably says more about how confusing a battle can be, especially when recollected thirty or forty years later, than about any real contradition in facts.""Recollections"" actually has three parts: Spear's notes jotted down during the war itself; a first attempt at writing them up in narrative form around 1896, and a more finished attempt undertaken sometime after 1900. The post-1900 attempt is the most readable, and is presented first. It should be read in close conjunction with the end notes to understand the context in which Spear was writing. A comparison with the other versions provides an interesting lesson in historiography.Spear's recollections document the life of the regiment in camp and on campaign. He details the challenges posed by the weather, the terrain, the poor food, the often indifferent leadership, and the Confederates themselves. Spear writes in a matter-of-fact manner, interspersed with the kind of understated dry humor well-known to those who have lived in Down East Maine. His story is a remarkable tribute to the toughness of Civil War volunteers, who soldiered under sometimes appallingly bad conditions with grumpy good humor and perseverence. Spear comes across in this narrative as a dedicated, common sense officer who conscientiously carries out his duties. Spear's gift for observation captures, among other events, some excellent vignettes of the temporary truces established by opposing picket lines, the sometimes strange persistence of good manners in the midst of war, and the inherent brutality of combat.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and to casual readers looking for a sense of the times.",positive

The waiter passes himself off as a chef and asks his chef friend's help in preparing wonderful Italian dishes for the American girl. There's more to the plot.

I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book!

Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader.

B000N7612G,The Food Of Love,1.0,Not as good as I Expected,"Unlike the other reviewers, I was disappointed with this book. The author's passion is clearly food -- his writing is at its most vibrant and vivid when he's describing the cooking scenes, or Bruno's hunts at the market for the food he uses to prepare the next meal for Laura... I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish. Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary. In fact, it detracted. As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses. Especially in the beginning of he book, it was almost as though he trotted out every one that he knew just because he knew it. Cussing is like hot sauce -- a little goes a long way.",negative

Very Italian, very gourmet, very funny, very sexy, it's a perfectly delightful summer read, a mini holiday in Italia. Witty, satirical in places, sad in other places, but ultimately satisfying, Capella has captured personalities with style and precision. It reminded me of nothing so much as a Shakespearean comedy, not so much in terms of literary value, but with respect to its bawdiness, its charm and its humor. Delicioso and molto buffo! Bravo to the author - can't wait to read his next offering.",positive

When his roommate and friend, Tommaso, asks for his help to seduce an American tourist by secretely preparing wonderful meals for her, Bruno doesn't see the harm in agreeing to let Tommaso take the credit. Little does he know that the American woman, Laura, is the same one he has been watching in the local markets. Bruno creates foods that show his feelings, but Laura believes that Tommaso is the chef. What is she really falling for? The food that Bruno passionately prepares or Tommaso?It is a joy for any reader who loves food to read about the dishes that Bruno creates. This was a yummy book because of the delicacies and because of the love story. The author, Anthony Capella, really knows his Italian food! I highly recommend it!

""What was it?"" she asked.""It doesn't have a name,"" Bruno said. ""It's just... it's just the food of love.""

From the moment I picked up the book, if I wasn't chuckling, I had a smile on my face.The vivid description of characters, neighborhood, and locales reminded me of my time in Italy as study-abroad student. Each character was engaging and authentic - from the protagonists to the secondary characters.I loved the restaurant/kitchen scenes; the descriptions of Bruno shopping and cooking; and the scenes of the small Italian town where he found some solace.I got a kick out of the Italian sayings and their translations: Parla comme t'ha fatto mammeta. Translation: Speak as your mother showed you - i.e., Cut the [bull]. [Page 36]. Applied in appropriate segments, they were funny and added to the make up of the characters that used them. I could envision Tomasso and Bruno talking like that.Along with a happy ending, the story finishes with a few simple recipes. Normally, I don't cook, but I was inspired to try making some of the dishes. I'm happy to write that my cooking endeavors were a success.Cleverly written, THE FOOD OF LOVE is a recommended read.Fafa Demasio",positive
B000N7612G,The Food Of Love,4.0,Gastronomic delights,"For any kind of foodie or to anyone who delights in Italian cuisine, this book is a must. Tommaso is a handsome, very Italian looking young man who attracts girls like flies to honey, but who especially appreciates the charms of blonde, non-Italian females. He works as a waiter at one of Rome's most up market restuarants and shares an apartment with his old friend, Bruno, a rather plain looking man who happens to be a brilliant and inspired chef. Laura is an American art history student, in Rome on a scholarship, determined to follow the advice of her Italian girlfriend to find herself a boyfriend who is a chef, as they're supposed to be ""good with their hands"". When Laura and Tommaso meet, he introduces himself as a chef and a Cyrano de Bergerac situation occurs with Bruno cooking incredibly wonderful, sensual meals for Laura, for Tommaso to pass off as his own work. It's an engagingly light read, full of descriptions of mouth watering Italian dishes, overlaid with love and laughter, perhaps not for those readers who aren't at all interested in enjoying good food...and there are such people...but for those who enjoy the use of all of their senses, a sheer delight!",positive

The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more.

B000N7612G,The Food Of Love,2.0,"Light reading, light in substance","A clich&eacute;d storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the clich&eacute; for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.",negative

In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.",negative

B000N7612G,The Food Of Love,5.0,Cyrano de Bergerac goes to Rome,"I read this last week on a long-haul flight - perfect diversion on a noisy, crowded plane with indifferent plastic airline food!This is a take on the famous Cyrano story where an inarticulate man in love speaks to the love of his life through the only means at his disposal: in this case cooking rather than poetry.Bruno loves Laura who loves Tommaso who really could not give a damn about anyone except himself. Put them all into the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant, throw in a few comic extras (the college teacher with neuroses about food, the barrista determined to brew the best cup of coffee in the universe, ""quaint"" Mafioso, etc), add in a diversion in the rural depths of Le Marche and you have a very jolly read.If you like food, then you can smell the cooking and taste the flavours as they can only be experienced in Italy. You can walk the back streets, visit the markets and learn about the great Roman love of traditional food.My only criticism is that Laura is perhaps a bit over-drawn: she is too obviously a character created by a man rather than a woman and reminded me a little too much of the much admired Nigella Lawson.I agree with the reviewer who enjoyed the little asides of very rude Italian slang - a guide on what not to say when in Rome!I will most certainly be looking for other books by this most welcome new author.",positive
0688071643,Perry Mason in the Case of Too Many Murders,4.0,The Case of the Double Murder,"In Chapter 1 Gil Adrian walks into the Oaks Restaurant. Gil has been accused of bribing city and state politicians, and being connected to organized crime. A stranger joins him, and they begin to leave. Suddenly, Gil shoots this stranger and takes off in his black Mercedes. The police are called, and go to Adrian's house. They find Gil's wife outside, enter the house, and find Gil dead in the den from two shots to his head! [Gardner always played down the background corruption in his stories. The idea of a double murder popped into to my mind.] Chapter 2 provides an example of wrongful conviction, which happens more often than the dramas on TV would suggest. This is an omen for Chapter 3, where Mrs. Gil Adrian, the trophy wife, retains Perry Mason. Laurel doesn't know much about Gil's business, or of any powerful enemies. Does the political establishment want to hang the murder on Laurel and thus bury the scandal? Mason learns the stranger Gil shot was unidentified; all he had was cash, a phony driver's license, and a .22 pistol strapped to his ankle. Wasn't a .22 pistol the weapon of choice for hit men asks Mason? Mason contacts David Niles, a Federal prosecutor, and suggests an alliance. [This never happened in the original series, to my recollection.]Chapter 8 tells of the beating that was given to Paul Drake Jr. after he questions Anselmo Costa in Las Vegas. Perry Mason also visits Las Vegas to ask questions, but learns little more. The preliminary hearing in Chapter 19 is as good as Gardner's best. It tells why a defendant shouldn't wear sunglasses. Chapter 20 explains why getting testimony about 'Karl Braundorff' was important. This led to Janet Coleman, a 'roper' (like Raymond Schindler), who told of Gil Adrian's visit to Las Vegas. Then Anselmo Costa is summoned to the witness stand, but he asserts his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Perry Mason gets a clue from the artist drawings on TV. The bank is subpoenaed to find the last check written by Ralph Adrian, Gil's son, before Ralph was murdered. These clues help to solve the puzzle, and Laurel Adrian is freed.This story brings in updated procedures (the defense gets a list of the prosecutor's witnesses), and mentions the terrible traffic in Los Angeles since the 1960s. But the flavor of the original stories has been lost. Paul Drake has retired, and Perry Mason would be an octogenarian, if still alive. What is missing is a younger lawyer, Perry Jr. or Della Mason, to carry on the father's work. This story is like a good reproduction of an old master like Rembrandt, but in a modern setting. It lacks the dedications that were part of the original series.",positive
0688071643,Perry Mason in the Case of Too Many Murders,4.0,An enjoyable story if you can accept the new style,"The Perry Mason stories by Erle Stanley Gardner were written in such a distinctive style that it is easy to recognize and hard to mimic. Therefore, any fan of Perry Mason will have to accept the disappointment of reading this Mason book by another author of another time. Gardner's style and tone very much that of the thirties and forties, with different terminology and a different level of acceptance regarding how men looked at women.If you are capable of accepting the significant difference in style, then this book can be enjoyed. Some of the characters are changed, for example it is now Paul Drake Jr. doing the investigations and Ray Dallas has replaced Lieutenant Tragg. The hostility between Mason and the police has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect, within the bounds of their professional rivalry; Ray Dallas and Mason are friends.The story is formulaic of the Mason stories, a man is murdered and his estranged wife is falsely accused of the murder. Mason must piece together a series of sometimes-contradictory clues in order to unmask the guilty and free his client. In true Mason fashion, his questioning of a witness leads to a dramatic courtroom event where the murderer is revealed.Although Gardner wrote many Perry Mason stories and they follow a pattern, there are reasons to always want additional stories. Chastain's effort is a worthy addition to this set, while naturally different, it is still within the bounds of what a Perry Mason story should be.",positive

But more importantly, he presents approaches for formatting and organizing information so that it is clear and action-oriented.

This is not too surprising since the majority of foreign words and phrases used in English are European in origin, but still - you can count on one hand the non-European phrases. The only Japanese words included are nisei and sensai, and I would have expected wabi-sabi and umami at least to be included as well. There are no phrases from Native American languages, none from Africa or the Middle East.

Let me tell you...I am sooo glad that I did !!! I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a ""good day"". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the ""I know"" , ""Nice try"" and ""I love you too much to argue"". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!!

You WANT your children to become strong, responsibly adults--so you need to let them develop the skills they need to succeed on their own.You also want to do so in a way that is LOVING and not coming across as punishing or the bad guy.

I enjoy sitting down with a 200+ page book, but not so my husband. I have been trying to get him on board with the Love and Logic program, but he will not sit and read a book for that long! So when I saw this book, I thought it might peak his interest enough to get him to read it. This book is much shorter than some of the others and it thoroughly addresses problems associated with discipline. As with all of their books, there are lots of anecdotal stories with clear examples. He still didn't read the whole book, but he did walk away with a better understanding of the methods used. I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again. I keep this book handy just to remind myself to keep up with the program. It is much easier to quickly skim this short book than break out the original love and logic book and search for discipline. since beginning the program almost 2 years ago, parenting has been a lot more fun! I am also a teacher and these are great strategies! Wonderful supplement or stand alone book for Love and Logic!",positive

I have 2 toddlers and I think the Love and Logic books and videos are an indespensible resource. It seems to me that the previous reviewer was just looking for a forum to rant about something totally unrelated to these books. He also wasn't reviewing this book - I guess some people will actually mislead people to try and get their voice heard. If click on ""see my other reviews"" under his name you will see that he has reviewed every book in the Love and Logic series with this rhetoric that is based on complete ignorance. Charles Fay and Foster Cline (founders of Love and Logic) are from Evergreen Colorado - not Colorado Springs and have nothing to do with the whole ""family first"" thing. There is no affiliation whatsoever. Again, not sure what the other reviewer was talking about - but it is a shame that he may turn people away from a resource that is the most effective tool I have come across to raise children who are responsible, able to make choices effectively, have great self-esteem, and to avoid all the arguments and power struggles that come with parenting.",positive

B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,5.0,&quot;Dinner at Antoine's: An Intriguing Mystery Set in New Orlea,"&quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; written by Frances Parkinson Keyes is set in New Orleans during Carnival Season in January 1948. It is a mystery that endures the generations. I first read &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; ten years ago in 1990. I enjoyed the book so much that it inspired me to make a trip to the Crescent City. My love for the book has not died since that first reading.The mystery is terrific. When I began my second read of the book in May 2000, I was quickly swept into the plot. I didn't want to stop reading. The book is so well written that the characters, plot and setting come to life before the reader. As Ruth Avery, the main character, sees New Orleans for the first time, I too saw the city for the first time through her eyes. The author gives a complete picture of New Orleans society in 1948 through the many characters that she develops. Joe Racina and his wife Judith are middle class residents. Joe works as a reporter and Judith maintains their home. Judith has chosen not to hire help as she grew up in Connecticut on a farm. To the opposite extreme you have the Lanlande family at the top of society. Other characters include Russell Aldridge, architect; Vance Perrault, doctor; and Tossie Pride, personal maid. &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is an old fashion murder mystery that in the style of Agatha Christie is full of suspects. Once again I was intrigued until the end as I remained unsure of the murderer's identity until it was revealed. This book is by far the author's best and it makes you beg for a sequel.The added bonus to &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; are the physical descriptions of landmarks in New Orleans. The descriptions are so great that this book could almost be categorized as a travel essay. When I traveled to New Orleans, I used &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; as my guide. I quickly found Antoine's Restaurant and in the restaurant I found the Rex Room, 1840 Room, and Mystery Room just as the restaurant had been described by the author. The French bread, tomato aspic, oysters Foch, flaming pressed duck with cream and brandy, cherries Jubilee, and caf&eacute; brulot all enticingly described by the author can still be found on the menu. I quickly moved on throughout New Orleans finding the Court of the Two Sisters, Caf&eacute; Du Monde, the French Market, Jackson Square, the cathedral, St. Charles Avenue, the Garden District, Audubon Park, and the Metaire Cemetery. My most recent reading of the book has me wanting to return to discover the River Road and to find out if the Bar None Restaurant exists with its barbecued chicken, onion rings and corn fritters. Even if I find that the River Road and Bar None only exist in the author's imagination, she has so aptly described them that I will always feel as if I have actually visited.Reading &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is the perfect way to spend a weekend when you want to take a luxurious vacation in the comfort of your home.",positive
B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,4.0,Entertaining tale of old New Orleans,"Half soap, half Agatha Christie mystery, this story of New Orleans in the late 1940s is a charming and compelling story of love, deception, and murder. Populated by a complex and endearing (or repelling) cast of characters, this is an excellent story. (And why isn't it in print?!)Starting off at the restaurant Antoine's, it follows extremely rich playboy Orson Foxworth (yes, that is his real name) introducing his lovely niece Ruth Avery to the rich'n'famous of New Orleans. Among them are the beautiful Amelie Lalande, a self-absorbed but very lovely widow that Foxworth wants as a lover but is willing to marry; Odile St. Amand, Amelie's daughter, who is suffering from a disease she tries to hide; Leonce St. Amand, Odile's philandering husband; Caresse Lalande, Odile's little sister who is on the brink of a full-fledged affair with Leonce; Vance Perrault, a doctor who cares deeply for Odile; Odile's ex-lover, Sabin Duplessis; Joe Racina, a brilliant journalist, and many many others...After a fateful night where Odile's shaking hands cause her to spill wine on herself (similar to a bloodstain), Amelie refuses Foxworth's proposal as she doesn't want to leave her poor invalid daughter alone, and Leonce attempts a seduction. Motives are abundant when Odile is found dead in her bedroom - shot through the heart with a gift from her ex-lover. Many lives and destinies will change (some for the better, some for worse) before Odile's killer finds justice of a sort...The pace is pleasant and gradual, allowing us excellent insight into the characters. The descriptions of luxurious houses, restaurants and clothing (especially clothing!) are evocative and entertaining. No threads are left untangled, and the question of motive and reason is, frankly, as excellent as that of the Grand Mistress of Mystery, Agatha Christie.There is only one thing that kept this from being a five-star book: As it was written in 1948, this book has a rather stereotyped portrayal of African Americans, especially Odile's loving nurse Tossie. Despite the stereotype, I was pleased that Tossie was not played for laughs and was one of the more insightful characters in the story. The reader automatically connects with her (especially regarding her low, low, LOW opinion of Leonce) and is warmed by the last chapter regarding her.Though Ruth Avery is sort of the heroine, she is nevertheless not the central character. She is strong and independent, with little thought of social position; and, after Odile's murder, so is Caresse (whom I expected to hate but ended up liking). I hated Leonce, was charmed by Orson Foxworth and Joe Racina. I found the character of Amelie Lalande to be highly annoying, with her self-centered artificiality.Though there are a few pitfalls in this book, it is nevertheless an entertaining (and pretty clean as well) story about mystery and passion in New Orleans, a beautiful city. Well worth the read.",positive
B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,4.0,A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine's,"If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called ""Madame Castel's Lodger,"" which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller",positive

The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones.

B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,3.0,Decoy Mystery,"Picked this recently from Grandmother's shelf; she'd never read it, but her few months living in New Orleans were right around the time of the book. It will be hard for enlightened readers to believe that upper /lower classes would behave and communicate in stereotyped ways; umbrage is mis-taken. Not only can you trust an observant outsider resident of New Orleans writing in 1948 to have a perspective on 1948 New Orleans superior in details to that of postmodern criticism, but it's also easily forgotten by outsiders, even after this hurricane, that, in this city more than any other, people lived their lives in one or two neighborhoods. In other words, life itself was, from an educational standpoint, simplistic and regressive. Craving high-mindedness, a fatalistic New Orleanian you never will be. It's faintly surprising that people want it dressed up. This work sure doesn't oblige (attention to fashion and finery notwithstanding). Most of its characters do suit a place so set'n its ways that, even as the book was being written, leadership was passing to the smaller (later giant), more creative city that would eventually come to N.O.'s aid from a few hundred miles to the west.It would be standard (and a bit inaccurate) to say the setting is a character here. However, I will say something you rarely hear: stories exist so that the author has something on which to put the real communication. Forget the mystery. I'm nogood at figuring them out, yet I did. That's not what to read for. I read to soak in the place, the author's devotion to it, and then it just fits that the most humbly local person, the part of the tapestry the astute reader kept expecting to find dirt on, is revealed to have been good all along.",neutral
B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,1.0,Great Book--unacceptable condition,"I was looking forward to receiving this book, as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back, at my own expense, and to date, I have not had a refund.",negative
B000GSNTRC,Dinner At Antoine's,3.0,Very dated and predictable mystery,"I decided to read this book after a visit to New Orleans when I toured the home of the author. The book was mentioned during the tour as one of her most famous books.I can see why it is out of print. I almost quit reading it after 50 pages. To become classics, books need to have universal qualities that transcend time and place. Dinner at Antoines is filled with stereotypes.As another reviewer pointed out, the depiction of blacks in the novel is condescending and dated. They all talk like characters in ""Uncle Remus.""The blacks are not the only ones who talk like caricatures. The policeman Murphy talks like an Irish cop from the movies.Other characters also are stereotypes. They are the ruthless businessman (Foxworth), the shallow woman out for his money (Amelie), the noble statesman (Huntington), the philandering husband (Leonce), the flirt (Caresse), Latin beauty (Clarinda), caring old doctor the tough-talking policeman, the rugged archeologist, etc. None of them seemed real to me.The main women characters are interested only in clothes and men. Ruth is a rich 20-something clothes horse with a silver mink coat. Clarinda is considered an old maid at 27. Caresse goes to New York to become a model for a staid department store. None of them seems to have a brain.The plot also seemed a little creaky to me. I figured out ""who done it"" about half way through the book, even though many characters had a motive and there were clues pointing at several. I also easily figured out who would marry whom at the end.Another plot flaw is tha author does a lot of telling readers about characters and what is going on rather than demonstrating it by action.Most of the plot takes place over a week, yet a murder is comitted and solved, an engagement takes place and is broken and replaced by another, and Ruth agrees to fly to Hondourus marry a man she has known a week.As an example of 1950s race, class, and gender stereotypes taken to an extreme, the book is interesting. It was somewhat entertaining, but totally unbelievable. I did not believe in the world portrayed.That is the main difference between a classic like Agatha Christie's novels and this book. I believe in the worlds Christie creates, though they are set in past times and distant places. However, I feel that Parkinson's New Orleans is an unbelievable place with unbelievable people.",neutral
0473056070,The Faces of Homoeopathy,5.0,The Truth About Homeopathy,"Julian Winston's novel is the most in-depth and informative discussion on homeopathy that I have come across. The book makes good on its claim to insightfully delve into the fundamental philosophy of homeopathy. Also, Winston tackles the important and controversial question of scientific rigor that plagues this medical breakthrough. He makes it systematically clear how the medical philosophy of homeopathy is scientifically rigorous. Also mentioned are the innovative medical thinkers known as the original homoeopaths, the decline of homeopathy at the beginning of the 20th century, and the resurgence of this medical philosophy towards the end of this same century. It is ideal for those readers attempting to gain greater medical recognition of homeopathy or for those just interested in the history of this innovative healthcare technique. If one is looking for in-depth inforamtion on homeopathy that is historical, academic, and interesting, then The Faces of Homeopathy is in my opinion the best book to buy.",positive
0473056070,The Faces of Homoeopathy,5.0,Not a novel,"This is to correct the previous review: Faces of Homeopathy is not fiction (not a ""novel"") it's the true story of the history of homeopathy focused particularly on the history of homeopathy in the USA.

I always refer them to this book. And no their queries aren't as simple as &quot;What are the params for an anchor tag?&quot;. That any book on HTML can answer. It would be more like &quot;I just can't get this page to have the same gap between two tables. All my code is perfect, I'm at my wits end!&quot;. The answer would be something only an expert can point out, like &quot;Hey you have a newline between your tables in your code. Yes HTML doesn't care about newlines but some browsers do.&quot;Truly this book will answer a lot of questions like that. If you ever are gonna work with HTML or have been working with HTML but haven't read this book, your eyes will be opened either by the fact that you didn't know so many things, or by the fact that a human being could stuff so many facts into a single book.If you are the type who needs a pocket reference maybe you are at the wrong place, but then perhaps you'd demand a pocket reference for building a space craft too!

B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,2.0,Omissions Diminish Usability as Reference,"There are numerous problems with this book as an HTML &quot;reference.&quot;First, an irritation for anyone using this book as a practical reference to look up tag details is that looking up tags is needlessly inefficient. They're supposedly all in the 250-page Appendix A, but to find one you have to go to the Appendix A section in the table of contents at the beginning of this bulky 1100-page tome, look up the page # listed there, then go to that page. The obvious alternative would be phonebook-style page headers showing the first tag name on each page so readers could locate a tag of interest directly. Why wouldn't a tech book publisher have this figured out?The cover says &quot;up-to-date for latest versions&quot; of Netscape and IE without specifying dates or version #'s. The printing date is hidden in the ISBN code. I find this practice questionable.Although pages 7 and 682 say all documents should begin with &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, this tag does not seem to be fully described anywhere. The syntax suggested on p. 682 (with a single pair of quotes) conflicts with the HTML 4 examples on p. 60.The book cover trumpets &quot;comprehensive&quot; coverage of HTML 4 as well as: &quot;extensive details on Cascading Style Sheets 1 &amp; 2.&quot; One could be forgiven for figuring this means fairly full coverage of CSS. However, the preface draws a distinction between HTML and CSS, speaking of &quot;HTML 4 ... _along with_ new technologies that affect HTML, such as CSS ...&quot; and announces an intention &quot;to do one thing the best I can: cover HTML.&quot; The implicit disclaimer is not idle. Whatever the process that upgraded the previous edition to this one, this book is by no means a comprehensive reference for CSS.",negative

This book starts off teaching the basics, like how to start your HTML document with the HEAD and BODY tags, and goes all the way into using HTML tables to design your website and using HTML forms. By the end of the book, I knew everything, and was able to move onto more advanced subjects such as PHP or CGI-scripting. This book is the perfect way to get started if you're interested in pursuing a career in web development or application programming.

Its extremely comprehensive and well organized, with lots of clear examples. It even covers some of the basics of JavaScript and CGI (though you'll still probably want/need another book that covers those topics exclusively, if you're interested in them.)Probably the only real complaint that I would have about the book is that its HUGE. There's some sections in the book that probably could quite easily have been cut or shrunk down. I kind of got the feeling that they wanted to stretch the book out to 1200 pages as a marketting ""Look at how huge our book is!"" thing. They probably could have made it ~1000 pages rather easily, which would have made the book easier to handle.In addition, some sections of the book are somewhat outdated.

I consider this book more of a course instead of a reference book which one refers to when they need to know a certain tag or command to get what they want. The reason why I gave this book 4 stars, is becuaes this is the only html book I thought was worth buying (esp. compared to other HTML books which ran up to 60 dollars) and have not read any other books on this subject.

There are several ways the material could have been organized, and as an experienced HTML writer I would have organized it differently, but I believe the author's organization makes the material more accessible for new and less experienced developers.Any criticisms I may have of this book are very minor compared to the excellent job the author has done with this book, and I would recommend it for anyone who has to write HTML, with or without the aid of an HTML editor.",positive

Mr. Powell's writing style allowed me to retain more than I expected I would. I immediately put into use many of these tags to take my website from average to very efficient (and cool if I do say so myself).

B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,The Only HTML Text You will Need,"When learning a new subject, I sometimes find it helpful to begin with a Visual Quickstart or Sam's Teach Yourself, then an intermediate text (if needed), and finally an O'Reilly Nutshell or Wrox Professional to deepen understanding and use as a reference.Powell's Complete Reference on HTML performs the task of all three levels.The first 212 pages, ""Web Basics,"" save beginners the need for an ""HTML for Dummies."" The next 475 pages provide a well-organized presentation of HTML mechanics including presentation, layout, cascading style sheets, client/server side programming, DHTML, XML, and web hosting. Throughout this material, sample code is presented and explained to illustrate the concepts presented. Finally, 430 pages of appendices provide reference level detail that will remain valuable indefinitely.The later chapters (programming, DHTML, XML) are overview in nature. (ASP is discussed in five pages.) This is appropriate, for each of these subjects requires a text of their own. The overviews are valuable as they present these subjects in the context of HTML and how they can work together. They also give the reader a basic platform from which to study in greater detail.Certainly worth mentioning also are the numerous tips and valuable remarks sprinkled throughout the book. In my case there were several one-line statements worth the purchase price.This book is a well-written and thorough text that a beginner can use to learn HTML and an advanced web developer can use as a reference or to polish up. I can't compare this with others books on the subject. It hasn't been necessary to read any.",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,4.0,I bought this book after reading these reviews...,"and I have been quite satisfied.Although I don't think a &quot;Complete&quot; reference book on programming, especially HTML, can exist, this is as complete and updated as it gets.Being a professional and advanced programmer I might be tempted to claim this as the best book there is, but for beginners I suggest they start with a book which is more of a &quot;tutorial&quot; than a &quot;reference&quot;. A smaller book that puts more emphasis on &quot;teaching&quot; the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource. But after that I strongly suggest they get this book.Remember, no single programming book can ever be a good reference while being a good tutorial. And we need both.",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,A comprehensive and &quot;user-friendly&quot; guide to HTML/DHTML,"&quot;HTML: The Complete Reference, Second Edition&quot;, by Thomas A. PowellOur NST/Engineers company reviewers found this over 1000 page compendium to be an ideal training text and desktop reference for a wide spectrum of web page designers. Individuals working to improve company intranet and extranet communications will be well-served by the examples given of code and scripting followed by what you can expect to see. Professionals seeking guidance in advanced HTML, DHTML, XML, and related internet savvy can expect to increase their understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.We found excellent coverage of the pitfalls of page preparation without knowledge of the differences between popular browser capabilities. The browser versions expected to be in common use for the next few years of Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, WebTV, and a few others, and how to allow for their different interpreting capabilities , is covered throughout the book.Hundreds of pages of appendixes explain what you can and can't do with HTML elements and style sheets. The function, power, and use of Java Script in its several variations are explained with examples. Author Thomas A. Powell, an expert Web consultant and Internet applications teacher at University of California at San Diego, explains the centrality of HTML while predicting changes that XML and other methods may bring in the future. He cites lots of free online Web sites, at all levels, to augment material in the book.We found the writing style, loaded with useful examples and stabs of humor, to be an easy read. This is a body of knowledge that must be understood at higher than an entry level by industrial, academic, and small business practitioners alike who see the need for an effective Web presence.",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,3.0,Not Good Enough,"I bought this book based on the Amazon Reviews and after using it I must disagree with the weight of on-line opinion. Not that it is a bad book. It just isn't what the reviews led me to expect. My main disappointment is the poor structure and organization. It has a thrown-together feel, more like a collection of separate and poorly integrated sections than a single well-organized book.Some examples: Even after marking the page edges it is still difficult to find what I want quickly. The text sections are only average and not at all comprehensive. To learn HTML or CSS, you'd be better off getting a book (or books) that is not trying to be everything at once. And the reference sections are also a disappointment. The main headers do not stand out from the repeated subheadings so one becomes lost easily. There is not enough detail on differences between the major browsers. The CSS &quot;reference&quot; is a mess. It is broken into subsections which disrupt the alphabetical order and is sorely lacking in the kind of detail that is critical to successful style-sheet implementation.As I said, it's not a bad book. It's just not good enough. For total newbies, Castro's QuickStart Guide is far superior. On CSS, try O'Reilly's &quot;definitive&quot; guide. Not sure what to recommend as an HTML reference. I'm going to try Goodman's &quot;Dynamic HTML.&quot;",neutral
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,A MUST HAVE,"This is ABSOLUTELY the Best HTML book. I got this book at the same time I got my first job as a web developer. My main job was to layout HTML pages for companies including GE and Sherwin Williams. I found this book indispensable. This book is great for a beginner and a superb reference for an HTML guru. The tutorials are great and the appendixes are wonderful. Although, the only HTML book you will need; you will need other books to cover topics such as CSS, JavaScript, and XML. The book gives you only a brief introduction to these branches of web development. If you use or want to use HTML buy this book!",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,Real HTML for people who build sites for a living,"This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,4.0,Not as good as the 2nd Edition,"This is a great book but I didn't think it was as good as the previous edition.Firstly I found a few too many errors that would trip up beginners to HTML/CSS. I checked the errata section of the website but not a single error in the book was listed there (at the time of writing this). I can't believe they are unaware of them, especially as this book has been out for several months now.Secondly the author keeps plugging his other book, so much so that he includes an entire chapter from that book here. Although it may of had some relevance I don't think it should of been added, as in my opinion it was clearly intended as a promotion of his other publication. I certainly don't object to being made aware of an authors publications, for instance in a list at the end of the book, but not like this.On the plus side this book does cover HTML exceptionally well, all the expected stuff like frames, tables, layers, forms, links, media types etc are explored. XHTML is also covered but don't expect much, the differences are only in the rules of writing the language, which are explained. Note that there isn't a chapter dedicated to XHTML but you are made aware of the differences between HTML mark-up and XHTML mark-up when necessary.Like previous editions this book does cover a lot of theory, e.g. logical versus physical mark-up, protocols, mime types, parsed html etc.There is also a chapter dedicated to CSS1 and CSS2 which is pretty complete. The CSS2 section includes coverage on the various new pseudo elements and selectors introduced in CSS2. There is also a reference section covering CSS1 and CSS2 at the back of the book, and it includes proprietary properties for Internet Explorer.SSI is also covered in this book. There are also very basic introductions to XML, JavaScript, server side technologies and DHTML. These are more about what they can do as opposed to teaching you them.The reference section has been organised alphabetically this time, so it is much easier to use than previous editions. They include coverage of XHTML, additions to WebTV, JavaScript event handlers and the usual HTML stuff. There are also reference sections for colour codes and character entities.Finally this is the first Complete Reference book I have purchased that didn't fall apart, so there is no need to buy a binder this time around.",positive

B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,4.0,"Handy, but has redundancy","One of the flaws of this book is that the author has to make every point two times. For example, the structure of an Internet Protocol address is covered twice in two separate sections, for a total of 10+ pages. I find that addressing has been adequately covered in other HTML books in 2-3 pages. As another example, the author mentions a trick of prefetching an image by rendering it with a height of 1 and width of 1. This trick is mentioned in full detail (paragraphs) twice in two seperate sections.The author seems to feel that every chapter should be complete in that it covers all tricks. For a reader who reads several chapters at a time, sections become redundant. I agree with the reviewer who said that the book could have been shortened ~100 pages with no loss of value or continuity.",positive

B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,An intelligent and well-structured guide to HTML,"This book should rapidly become a standard reference work for anyone working with HTML. Given that the World Wide Web is something of a moveable feast, and given that HTML will probably be very different in ten years time, nevertheless Thomas Powell has put together a superb manual that presents information in a clear and concise fashion. His writing style is clear and articulate without the verbosity that is sometimes associated with what is, after all, a potentially complex subject. Information is easy to find and well indexed and the examples are copious. Mr Powell is also to be congratulated for creating a work that should appeal to beginner and expert alike. In short, just about the best work on HTML around - I just wish I'd bought the hard-back version as my copy is looking decidedly tatty because of the use it gets!",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,Excellent coverage for both beginning and advanced users,"This book was the first HTML book I ever purchased, and unless a change is made to the language, will be the only one I ever need. I was a newcomer to raw HTML coding before I bought this book, and it has proven to be an invaluable learning tool and reference. The coverage of the language is excellent, and the section on Style Sheets is very in-depth. Also, the appendicies at the end of the book contain complete information on every HTML tag and their associated attributes for quick look-up.Although this book can be a little difficult to get started, once you get past the introductory chapters and into the section on actual HTML code it is very straighforward. It provides many code examples along with the results produced, which in my opinion is one of the best ways to teach any language.I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn HTML as a hobby or for business - it covers everything you will need to know.",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,Makes designing and updating web pages a snap!,"In the computer industry the internet is an enormous entity.

You have the opportunity to learn DHTML, XML and integrate your work with Cold Fusion and other web applications.Powell gives you a breakdown of each tag, form, frame layout, table setup, font reference, sheet styles and so much more. There is a never-ending use for this book and from the novice to the expert. Everyone can learn something.A small edition to the book might be a cd-rom with various web utilities and special effects for pages, but other than that you will be hard pressed to find a more complete reference manual.

B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,3.0,Good Overview,"This book is good in the sense that it introduces HTML and HTML commands. The biggest flaw in this book, however, is the lack of emphasis on XHTML. The cover boasts that it includes full XHTML within it; however, it is really only one chapter out of the whole book. As someone who likes to keep up with the W3C standards and current technology on web pages, I have found that out of this entire book, I really only use chapter 13 which is on style sheets. I read the book and got to this chapter only to realize that everything I had just read wasn't information I could use.This book also includes an introduction to other aspects of HTML such as JavaScript and Server Side Programming, as well as, web maintenance. However, it only serves as an introduction and points the reader to other books. This book is great as an overview, but it does a poor job at helping you move from reading about HTML to actually doing the current HTML you would see on your favorite website.I would recommend finding a book on CSS and XHTML that gives a short introduction to the basics of HTML and then gives more emphasis on the current technology being used.",neutral
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,3.0,Not a horrible place to start.,"I actually bought and read the &quot;The Complete Reference HTML second edition&quot;.I'm sure they are similar with some slight additions explaining some newer browser compatibility issues and possible additions to HTML and the use of style sheets.The Second Edition was literally a bad book. My copy broke down and all the pages were falling out in clumps of about 50 pages making it tough to use.But the content of the book is simple. All or most of HTML uses, concepts and tags are explained one by one in a comprehensive manual-type book.Not a great Tutorial type book. Not really for beginners. This is definitly a great reference though. For those who know how to use HTML but need to &quot;checkup&quot; on some things sometimes this book is for them.",neutral
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,The only HTML book you'll need,"My first &quot;The Complete Reference&quot; book was for Java 1.0. I was so happy with that book that when I went looking for an HTML manual, the first one I looked at was this one. And it's a good thing I did, because it's the only book I ever need to look at for a reference. It really does contain everything I can think I would need to write HTML code at any level of complexity or depth, and I've been writing HTML code since 1994, professionally since around 1997. If you're a beginner, the book spends some time in the beginning teaching you the basics and concepts, everything you should need to get started on your first pages. And if you're a novice or expert, the book will scale to your level of knowledge gracefully, it covers the gamut, even extending into Cascading Style Sheets, Dynamic HTML and a brief introduction to XML (if you need an XML manual you should get one dedicated only to XML, this reference is not complete for that purpose). The title couldn't be more appropriate, as inside the book, there is a complete reference of every single valid HTML tag and attribute you could use, even including explanations for what each attribute means! If you get just one HTML book, get this one.Keep in mind that this book does not cover any WYSIWYG tools for creating HTML pages (such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver). This is just for writing the HTML yourself with a text editor, or to assist you in using the WYSIWYG tool of your choice, as most of them allow you to manipulate the HTML and attributes manually.",positive

B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,Simply awesome,"This book is just spectacular!I have been a web developer for several years now, and I have read many books about HTML and related subjects. This book covers it all. But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won't need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too.",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,5.0,The only HTML book you'll ever need.,"The first thing you'll notice about this book is its size, over 1000 pages for HTML, a bit much I first thought. However only the first few hundred pages cover HTML, and it's covered extremely well to. If you have read any other book on HTML then you won't believe just how much has been missed out until you read this book. HTML is much bigger than you would have ever thought.The book teaches you a lot of theory, areas such as logical and physical structure, doctype definitions, media types, encoding types (to name but a few) are explored, and the usual tutorials on tables, frames, linking, image maps, graphics, meta tags etc are all there, but more information is provided.There is also a chapter dedicated to style sheets which covers both CSS1 and CSS2. As HTML 4.0 encourages you to use style sheets instead of standard HTML, it was good to see this chapter. This was my first exposure to CSS and I'm very confident using it now. I don't believe you will have to buy an additional book on CSS.Other chapters include introductions to other technologies like JavaScript, server side programming, XML and DHTML, but these are only basic introductions, do not expect to learn these technologies from those chapters, they just give you a taste.The remainder of the book consists of the reference sections. These throughly cover (among other things) HTML and CSS. The HTML section includes additional tags and attributes specific to each browser, including those for webTv. Character encoding is also covered.I have only two criticisms of this book. Firstly it falls apart in your hands, so if you buy it expect to buy a binder as well. Secondly although the reference section is full and complete it isn't laid out very well.To sum up this book is both a tutorial and a reference and is always on my desk.I also own the third edition of this book but I don't think it is as good as this edition.",positive
B0000630MU,HTML: The Complete Reference,3.0,Good but not Great reference Book,"After looking over many reviews of HTML references, I bought this one. While I'm not diappointed I don't think it lives up to all of the 5 star ratings. Perhaps if you are considering constructing elaborate sites with CSS styles,etc this is a great book. It cetainly gives one an overview of the web but seems frequently light on examples for many of the most frequently used items. If you are trying to learn enough to tweak existing simple sites (my objective) then there is a lot of unnecessary stuff. I have to admit that the tone bothered me as well; it seems the author complained constantly that the web designers were not using HTML &quot;properly&quot; - too many workarounds, etc. Real life doesn't always conform with intent!I use the book as a reference but have found it easier to learn things from on-line sources and real life code.",neutral
B0006W83VA,The Cosmic Decoy (Perry Rhodan #21),5.0,Why is there a Cosmic Decoy?,"Book # 21 of this Space Opera is the beginning of a huge story arc, which concludes in Book # 41, ""The Earth Dies"".These mega-stories are called ""bands"" in the original German. This band deals with the first true encounter between the fledgling fleet of Terra and the might of the galactic empire.In ""The Cosmic Decoy"" we are reunited with Cadet Julian Tifflor, whom we met in the Mutant Master trilogy of stories. Cadet Tifflor is chosen by Perry Rhodan to become a Cosmic Decoy. At least four of the ships of the Terranian fleet have disappeared, and Rhodan wants to know where they went.In just the first book, we discover that the four missing ships were stolen by the Springers, a race of space-faring traders with no morals other than their own. Julian is prepared for this mission with a ""secret"" message - and a hidden special transmitter that is only capable of being received by people with telepathic powers, such as several members of Rhodan's Mutant Corps. Even Tifflor is unaware that he is a living psychic transmitter. According to plan, Tifflor is kidnapped by the Springers, but he is whisked away to a secret base before Rhodan and his men can catch up. We meet a few of the Springers and begin the process via which Rhodan plans to make the universe believe that the Earth has been destroyed.Next episode - Number 23 - ""Fleet of the Springers"".I've never been this impressed by a series. I'm reminded of old cliffhanger serials like ""Buck Rodgers"" or ""Flash Gordon"" when reading these marvelous books. This series is still being published in Germany and is now well over 2,000 stories. It's too bad American publishers stopped after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another letters column. There are also extra stories - one continuing adventure, similar to a serial, and some ""Shock Shorts"" - continuing a series of SF short stories at the end of each book. Although these stories have nothing to do with Perry Rhodan, they are worth looking at.It's well worth reading the entire Rhodan series.",positive
B000N63OP4,Cinema and Soviet Society; From the Revolution To the Death of Stalin.,5.0,An Essential Book on Soviet Cinema,"Anyone who wants to understand the movies of the Soviet Union should start with this book. It is very thorough and written in a lively, bright style that is free of academic jargon.Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets. He pays equal attention to the &quot;high art&quot; films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s, like &quot;Volga-Volga.&quot;) He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism, World War II, and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end, the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However, one should be thankful for what one has, and in this volume, one has a truly indispensible book.",positive
1569474400,Behind the Moon,4.0,"A multicultural, multigenerational story of acceptance","This is the story of three friends and their families. This trio consists of ""multicultural rejects""; Justin ""Jay"" is the gay child of Chinese immigrants; Tien Ho, conceived out-of-wedlock during the Vietnamese War by a Vietnamese mother and African-American GI father; and Gibbo, a chubby, white, socially inept Australian who yearns to be Asain. Each character feels out of place in society and clings to each other only to find that they are even out of place with each other.After drifting apart for a few years, their parents take action to bring them together. They orchestrate a dinner to celebrate the life of Princess Diana and watch the live coverage of her funeral. During the course of the dinner, Justin is outed, Tien's fiance is knocked unconscious, everyone is ashamed when it occurs to them that they forgot Gibbo's birthday. And to top it off, the food is awful!Despite this disastrous dinner, it sets a series of events in motion to reconcile not only the three friends, but the families. In the worst of times, Justin's in a coma, Tien is getting divorced, and Gibbo is accused of being a stalker, they all come together to support each other.This book is captivating from the start and is wonderfully written. The author takes you on a journey with each character, bringing depth and perspective to the series of events. I came away from this book having learned something about people, life and relationships. For instance:Tien's mother, Lihn, in love with a black American solider, is rejected by her family for her love. In a letter to her father, she quotes a Vietnamese author I'd never heard of before, Nguyen Du:""It blows one day & rains the nextHow often does chance favor us in the Spring?If you ignore and scorn my desperate loveyou'll hurt me- yet what will it profit you?""The Tale of KieuThis passage struck me as relevant to my own life as many of my friends are in the stage of life where they are deciding who to spend the rest of their lives with. Not everyone is making good choices, in my opinion, and it's always difficult to know when you should speak up to prevent disaster and when to let people make their own mistakes.

1569474400,Behind the Moon,4.0,Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places,"Hsu-Ming Teo's novel was published in Australia in 2005 and released in the US this year. It is basically a story about three friends with multi-cultural backgrounds. Justin Cheong is a Chinese-Australian who is the picture-perfect son. His world becomes increasingly unstable as he comes to terms with his attraction to other men. Tien is the child of a Vietnamese woman and an African-American soldier. Living with her aunt and uncle in Australia, she straddles worlds of identity between Asian culture, Australian culture and wondering about her American father. Gibbo is a Caucasian Australian whose culture serves as a foil to the Asian. Overweight, Gibbo lacks confidence. He bonds with Justin & Tien as outcasts.Teo sets up the classic ""No Exit"" triangle where Justin loves Gibbo, Gibbo loves Tien, and Tien loves Justin. After the elementary to high school years, the friends draw apart. Justin goes camping with Gibbo with unfortunate results. Tien goes to prom with Gibbo with unfortunate results. The novel reunites them toward the end of college @ the Dead Diana Dinner (DDD) where relatives gather to morn the loss of the British princess and watch her funeral on TV. Here, the parents begin to take center stage and we go through their history. Gibbo's mom has been like a mother to Tien, but backs off when Tien's mother Linh finally arrives in Australia from Vietnam, via a Malaysian refugee camp. Gibbo's dad is a brusque medical doctor who gets upset with Justin's dad Tek and spills the beans about Justin's sexual orientation. Meanwhile, everyone has forgotten that this is also the meek Gibbo's 21st birthday. Tien plans to announce her engagement to Stanley, but Gibbo's mom knocks him out thinking she's caught an intruder.From the DDD, the novels spends several chapter in flashback as we learn all about Linh's history and her love affair with American GI Bucky. We also flash forward to see Tien in San Francisco with her husband Stanley and follow them through his modern art phase and Tien's flirtation with a new age feminist group that enjoys giving themselves haircuts in private places. Justin's life resembles that country song, ""Looking for love in all the wrong places."" Meanwhile, Gibbo develops an unwelcome attachment to Linh.This episodic novel sounds a bit melodramatic, but reads well. The characters are distinct and interesting, although none are perfect. Teo tries wax philosophical about the weaving of relationships into a lifetime pattern. For me, the Asian cultural self-analysis was interesting as people from various cultural backgrounds try to establish their own roots. Enjoy!",positive

B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",5.0,Climbing the rungs,"The title of this book, `God was in the Place, & I, i Did not Know', may seem a bit cumbersome (and even, to some, looks like it has a typographical error. However, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner draws this title from the Torah, the book of Genesis to be precise. It is the exclamation of Jacob who, upon waking from his dream about the ladder connecting heaven and earth, makes a startling realisation about the reality of the seemingly mundane and ordinary place where he had stopped for the night.In the prologue, Kushner develops an exegesis and hermeneutic of Genesis 28:16 more fully, and in so doing, illustrates many of the problems we regularly encounter, both in reading scripture as well as in interpreting daily life experience. He places this story in strong connection with the ordinary, even relating the angels on the ladder to common humanity:`There is another, even more obvious interpretation. The angels did not reside in heaven at all. They lived on earth. They were ordinary human beings. And, like ordinary human beings, they shuttled back and forth between heaven and earth. The trick is to remember, after you descend, what you understood when you were high on the ladder.'Kushner examines the way in which sages have interpreted this passage, and provides insights into history, psychology, philosophy, and scriptural study in the process. Each interpretation has had what one might call a personal conversation and experience with Jacob. In fact, each of these interpreters is portrayed as being on the ladder, rising and descending. The text is structured in this way. The interpreters are:+RashiSchelomo ben Yitzhaki, RashiThe key word for this interpretation is awareness. This is very important for making the kind of realisation that Jacob made. It is very important for us as we perceive the presence of God in our own lives.If I had known God was here, I wouldn't have gone to sleep.+KotzkMenachem Mendl of KotzkThe key concept here is egotism. Only by stripping away the ego can one begin to understand the presence and the personality of God.God was here because I was able to subdue my ego.+LudomirHannah Rachel Werbermacher, the Maid of LudomirA remarkable woman, a teacher of the Hasidim (who listened to her teaching through a half-open door, so as to preserve distance, and perhaps preserve a fiction that they were not in fact being taught by a woman), whose insight gave her access to the other side, or the many other sides, of stories being considered.God is present, even in the midst of evil.+MezritchDov Baer, the Maggid of MezritchThe word Maggid means 'storyteller'. Through the stories, here the key is self-reflection, to find meaning in the innermost being, to find that still, small voice that can only speak in silence and the absence of our own activity.God was here because I stopped being aware of myself.+NachmaniShmuel bar MachmaniWho was Jacob, and why should he know this? Who is God, and why should God do this? These are questions that are historical as much as theological or psychological, and it is in our history and God's history that we find meaning and identity.I could have climbed this ladder of history.+De LeonMoses ben Shem Tov de LeonA remarkable book, lost for a time, whose existence was denied even by Moses de Leon's widow, the Zohar, gives astonishing insight into the interior of God, reality, and our selves, and how to find a deep connection that is always present and never finished. Attributed to another author, Shimon bar Yohai, Kushner speculates that perhaps they shared the same soul. The completeness of the self of the universe connects through Jacob's story here.I is the Lord your God+OstropolShimshon ben Pesach OstropolerBeyond the question and awareness of the self of God and the self of the universe is the self, basic and simple, complex and intricate. Rabbi Shimshon put names to the kelipot, the broken shards of creation. We are all a part of a whole, a broken piece in and of ourselves. Our awareness of this helps begin the process of reunion.I didn't know that my name was part of God's nameEach interpreter's chapter stands on its own merits, but each is connected to the other, and to a wider body of interpretation and scholarship, by the use of side notes and references done in (what I would describe as being) a proto-talmudic structure. The Talmud has been described by some as one of the world's first hypertexts, with cross-links and chains that lead through the text -- this book does similar linking.Rabbi Kushner concludes by linking all the stories to the reader:`Each person has a Torah, unique to that person, his or her innermost teaching. Some seem to know their Torahs very early in life and speak and sing them in a myriad of ways. Others spend their whole lives stammering, shaping and rehearsing them. Some are long, some are short. Some are intricate and poetic, others are only a few words, and still others can only be spoken through gesture and example. But every soul has a Torah.'The relative place of self (both as an I and as an i) in God's life and universe becomes more apparent through these stories. Human beings are important, yet who can be important in relation to God? Yet, who is not important in relation to God? May this work help you discern where God is in your life, and what you are called to be.",positive
B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",5.0,The hand of God,"As you have gathered from the main review, this book focuses on the meaning of just one verse in Genesis, when Jacob awoke from the ladder dream. Usually Rabbis pick up on a verse just a couple verses back where &quot;the Angels of God were going up and down the ladder&quot;. The focus is that they start on Earth and go to Heaven - not the other way around.This book is great because it is like there is a dialog accross the space-time continuumn with 7 Rabbis in different locations and centuries arguing about their 7 different interpretations.One interpretation based on the fact that there are two &quot;I's&quot; in the verse spelled differently in Hebrew. It is that my Godlike &quot;I&quot; did not know God was present because my ego &quot;i&quot; was in the way. Jacob's chance to experience God was diminished because the ego &quot;i&quot; was ragiling off its commentary. This concept is similar to Buddism.Kushner adds an 8th interpretaion in his prolouge - which I won't spoil by going into detail. I heard Kushner talk at a Synagouge in Austin, Texas and he summarized his interpretation by finishing, &quot;Hold up your hands before your eyes. You are looking at the hands of God.&quot;A great book on modern Jewish mystism.",positive
B0006P6WSS,"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning",5.0,Poetic and Intelligent,"Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, ""You are all liars!""3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. ""Too much concentration can be worse than none at all"" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The ""I did not know"" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the ""I.""5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, ""Frees slaves,"" and then ""Call anytime"" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the ""I,"" the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, ""God was in this place and I did not know it was i."" We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent.",positive

B0008852GG,The soul of man under socialism,3.0,Oscar Wilde: Theory on a Holiday,"Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man under Socialism depicts the tangential and unintended callousness of socialistic thinking when it is merely theoretical and future-based and is not also activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde understands perfectly well that one of the principal goals of socialism is the elimination of poverty: ""The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible."" That might be the aim, but what should be done in the meantime to alleviate the suffering of the poor? In a word, the answer for Wilde is ""nothing."" He argues that charitable attempts to help the poor both fail to help the poor but also ""prolong"" the disease that cause poverty. The disease, of course, is the system of capitalistic exploitation. It is wrongheaded, Wilde argues, to use the fruits of capitalism to redress the consequences of its rampages: ""It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair."" While Wilde is confident that the ravages of poverty will cease in a future socialistic society, he opposes all palliatives for the poor and oppressed in the meantime. That is one of the consequences of confining socialistic thought to merely theoretical and future-based considerations and failing to also make it activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde's socialism of ""voluntary association"" of the future is individualistic (individuals should be free to choose their own work), anti-authoritarian, and government-less (largely anarchical). In fact, Wilde sees authoritarian socialism as constituting a worse state of affairs than capitalistic exploitation: ""If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.""Wilde extols the prospects of an anti-authoritarian socialistic society because of its potential to actualize individuality. But Wilde's individualism has a kind of hierarchy about it--one, it is impossible to fail to notice, that leaves persons like himself at the top: ""These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture--in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation."" Apparently, those given to other vocations are not quite as ""real"" and can only partially realize these Olympian heights.Soon Wilde's discussion of individualism acts as an unstable catalyst, causing him to veer into a wide variety of topics often inexplicably. But the topics that preoccupy him for most of the work are aesthetic and literary concerns, especially as they relate to the relationship between individualism and artistic expression. While this discussion has some merit and interest, it is difficult to imagine why these peevish considerations require the lengthy treatment they receive in a work entitled ""The Soul of Man under Socialism.""My reservations about Wilde's work notwithstanding, I do think this is a relatively important work to read. While the work as a whole lacks a coherence that could have made it more effective, many individual passages are keenly insightful and highly quotable.",neutral

Many intellectuals were interested in the theories, but Oscar was in his eyes an artist and an Individualist. Capital ""I"" on individualist.I couldn't find a date for this writing, but I believe his legal problems and the rumors preceding his legal problems were actually the motivation, and not economics or politics.As many artists and I consider myself one, believe their work and their life are one. Oscar showed his colors as far as common people go. I could not imagine him an equal to a chimney sweep or a waiter.Oscar was hurt and he was attempting to argue that life style, and art, especially his, should be free from the common people's rules. Poetry was not controlled because nobody read poetry.I find Oscar Wild a very human elitist and although I thought it sad, I enjoyed his work immensely and this work was no different.(PS: I really appreciate Kindle books.

B0008852GG,The soul of man under socialism,5.0,of great historical value,Ill try and type on my puny K three keyboard so bear with me here. This witing is about an ideal very popular in his time. Socialism has been incorporated into the US and other free world governments everywhere. Like any great concept it had to be blended with its polar opposite capitalism. This was most evident in the sixties and Nixons HMO programs of the seventies. Hey it gave birth to a compromise that led to a golden age of todays unprecidented easy lifestyles. Any person would be insane to want to go back in time and live their hardships. Think about it.....,positive

Arrrrgh.,"We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling.",negative

However they only address that issue once, and that's on the first page when mom and dad leave and it says that grandma and grandpa are watching them. They wave goodbye.Then all the rest of it is just Little Critter messing things up or having suggestions that aren't great (such as sucking up the curtain vacuuming, knocking over a vase dusting, spilling the paint, using too much toothpaste or dish soap, wanting to buy all junk food at the store, etc.)It really feels like this is so similliar or much more suited to the Little Critter I Just Forgot book or Little Critter Visiting Grandma and Grandpa. It has very little to do with getting your child ready to be away from mom and dad should they be going on a short trip so the book fails in what it appears to be trying to do based on the title. Most other Little Critter books do a great job of telling a story that covers some kind of kid issue or fear, this one just doesn't address the issue of the title and is dissapointing.",negative

050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),4.0,Enjoyable Read,"This was definitely worth reading! I became a fan of Christine Feehan only a few months ago and I hope she continues to write often as I have enjoyed all of her novels so far. This story was very enjoyable and interesting. I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters and also some of the secondary characters, especially the children. It was a little predicatable, but there is still a quality in Christine Feehan's writing that grabs you and keeps you interested... and wishing that it had not ended!The only compliants I have is that one of the brothers characters was undeveloped to the point that it did not make sense, as well as the &quot;special gifts&quot; that both the main characters had. The authors seemed to imply some power beyond ESP, but yet never expanded or provided any sort of explanation for these &quot;gifts&quot;.I am really looking forward to the next novel. I hope it will be a continuation (perhaps the Don's brother?) of this story. I am also still hoping for more vampire romances as well!",positive

The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE.

He has &quot;gifts&quot; of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the &quot;I hate you!&quot; temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed.

I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the &quot;dark&quot; series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!",negative

I have read several of Christine's Dark series so I knew that this would be a page turner and it was. This one is a gothic historical romance. It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte, or in English palace of death, to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done. There are some very interesting secondary characters that I think would make good heros and heroines for possible future books. Get this book. You'll really enjoy it.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),4.0,Engaging page turner!,"The Scarletti Curse is the story of a young and very innocent healer, Nicoletta, who is chosen to stand beside a powerful Don, the Don Scarletti, whom even the king feared. The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's, where the women they love end up dead, and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die, including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer), herself, is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath), and the story developed from there, with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night, the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot;, uncertain on what I would find. On one hand, she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her &quot;Dark&quot; series about the Carpathians. On the other, this was a non-Carpathian book, though a Gothic, so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here: Christine has hinted that Nicoletta and Giovanni have some relation to her Carpathian series. I look forward to her exploring that in more detail)I really hope that Christine explores Antonello's character. He was a secondary character and very mysterious, the only character that Christine did not explore in depth. He quite fascinated me. I would also like to see some explanation as to where Giovanni and Antonello got their telepathic abilities.Thank you, Christine! Keep up the great work, and I hope that the publisher will release a lot more books of your books A LOT faster, as I will buy every one.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),4.0,All of the elements I like in a romance,"As a fan of gothic and paranormal stories, this book appealed to me. True, it had a lot more sex than Victoria Holt or other gothic writer favorites ever included in their books, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Nicolette is a free spirit with a secret. She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders. They know Nicolette could be burned as a witch, otherwise. Don Giovanni, the dark brooding aristocrat, wants Nicolette the first time he sees her. Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die, he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don't believe in giving too much information in a review so I won't say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings, the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives, and last but not least, the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant, but not overly so. He had a soft, gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance, at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince, another book I have by her.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Excellent read!,"I became a fan of Christine's writing through her &quot;Dark&quot; series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong, compassionate, courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti, who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the &quot;Palazzo Della Morte&quot; where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy, like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine, for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide!",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Another great read,"Ms. Feehan has written another entertaining, and engrossing book. I got very little sleep the day I sat down to read Scarletti Curse, I didn't stop until I had read every page.Ms. Feehan's gothic bears her trademark paranormal touch. The hero, Don Giovanni Scarletti has telepathic abilities and the heroine, Nicoletta has healing abilities. While helping the Don's sick niece, Nicoletta catches the eye of the Giovanni, who decides that he wants her for his bride. Nicoletta is less than thrilled at that honor, since both her mother and aunt were killed under suspicious circumstances while employed at Palazzo Scarletti, a.k.a Palazzo della Morte (palace of death). Thus begins the tale of our fair hero and heroine. Will the Don be able to win Nicoletta`s heart? Should Nicoletta trust Giovanni? Will Nicoletta be the next victim of the Scarletti curse? What dark secret is the Scarletti family hiding? Strap up and get ready for one heck of ride as Nicoletta and Giovanni learn things that they never expected about themselves, and each other.Looking forward to reading more from this author.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Wonderful gothic,"Please keep in mind if you are an avid fan of Feehan, this is a different style of writing for her. I love her Dark Series and was even more impressed with her new Gothic novel. Our dark hero is made from the same mold that created her Dark Series men: powerful, dark, serious, passionate, and ofcourse possessive. We love these traits, that's why we keep coming back for more! She has created a wonderful book that includes drama, horror (as in strange things happening at the palace), and passion. I thought it was a stimulating, and thought-out plot with tense scenes that keeps you engrossed. The growing attraction and passion between the two main characters leaves you wanting to read it again. If you are fond of Gothic authors, Victoria Holt and Dorthy Eden, you will love this book.

Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with healing gift's .She embrace life with such open arms and feet ( you'll understand once you read it). Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery which makes you want to know him and his family even more. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.Christine Feehan has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit but I guess she wanted the readers to have a good visual through out the read.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),4.0,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Having read Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series, I have to say that I think this is her best book ever. THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn't quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),4.0,Brimming with mystery and . . . danger,"I must confess that I was very leery to begin reading this book. My feelings have nothing to do with Ms. Feehan's writing style. I so love Christine's Dark series, I feared that I would inevitably begin to make comparisons and would find this book a major disappointment. It wasn't.There is a terrible curse which plagues the Scarletti men. Every woman who enters the Palazzo as a bride winds up dead. What or . . . whom is causing these fatal accidents?Nicoletta is a healer who possesses &quot;special&quot; gifts. Deep within her being she senses when someone needs her. She is drawn to the great Palazzo knowing that there is a young girl inside who is desperately ill. Once inside those forbidding walls, she encounters Don Giovanni Scarletti known as Il Demonico (The demon).He is dark, brooding and utterly dangerous. Nicoletta instinctively senses the potential threat he poses to her yet she is drawn to him as he is to her. Even the knowledge of his dark and deadly reputation cannot sever the attraction from growing.Don Scarletti also possesses his own &quot;gifts&quot; and chooses her for a bride. What initially begins as a duty for Nicoletta turns into passion than into love. Will Nicoletta suffer the same fate as others have? Or will her unwavering love and ulfaltering courage finally bring an end to the family's deadly curse?You have to read the book in order to find out those answers and more. Enjoy!",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),3.0,Has enough mystery to keep you reading,"For many years, the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil, murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo, and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death), it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers, the current don has set his eyes on their healer, Nicoletta, the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine, with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue, and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial, but when I'm reading a historical novel, I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall, this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant, Antonietta Scarletti, in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment).",neutral

I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that, the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers.",neutral

Put it back.,"I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, ""leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to"". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier.",negative

050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),2.0,Not up to scratch!,I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.,negative
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),4.0,great,"for those of you intrested in gothic romance this is it i din't even know i would like them until i read this book this could be one of the best books written by christine feehan, as much as i would hate somebody to read my mind but Don scarletti does it in such a romantic way,you can almost feel it yourself.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),3.0,This book was so-so.,"At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to. It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti, she sensed something evil about him and his family. Don Scarletti had possession of her mind, body, and soul. His dark features were erotic, yet frightening to Nicoletta. However, I have found myself getting a little bored with the book. It seems as if something that is bound to happen, doesn't happen. It's a good read, but unfortunately I am getting restless and impatient with the Scarletti curse and the passionate fires between Nicoletta and Don Giovanni.",neutral

050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Beautiful & Touching,"I really love The Scarletti Curse, having reread it for more than 5 times I believe.The pacing is good, with enough action, excitement and unconditional love (a necessity to destroy the evil curse at work).The book starts with village girl Nicoletta being summoned to accompany the village ""healer"" Maria Pia, who raised Nicoletta since her mother's death, to the Scarletti Palazzo. They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book ""Dark Symphony, in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia, suffering from food poisoning. While both ""healer"" and assistant do their work, Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta, asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says ""I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think""!A few days later the ""healer"" and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again, but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant, but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta, who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up, a few murders commited, the staff gossip, while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Excellent Gothic romance,What an excellent book. Great use of characters and character growth. The chracters are revealed slowly in layers. Multidimensional supporting characters. There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.,positive

050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),2.0,Sure Miss,"I have loved all of Christine Feehans &quot;Dark&quot; novels. I was looking forward to the Scarleti novel as well. I was suprised at her change of writting style. I kept thinking I was reading a Ann Rice wanta be. The characters are now well drawn, Nicolette is weak, scared and is not consitant with her personality. We do not get to know what makes Giovanni &quot;tick&quot; he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanni,who is cursed, after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her, even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat, to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead, not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves, or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family &quot;curse&quot; for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse. I do not recommend the book, it was a disappointment to me. The writter spent to much time using words to describe the landscape and the buildings and the rooms and I don't remember what all else, and she did not develope her characters.",negative

Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting, sensuous, just flat out stunning way. This book, though not about the vampire-like beings in her others, adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing, and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting, and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited, naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing.",positive

Once at this point, the plot seems to take up some speed and has a lot of suspense and gothic darkness. Although some questions are answered, I felt like she could have taken some of the characters a bit further. I also felt like some of the scenes were startlingly switched, for the suspense, and I had to go back and re-read a page again to figure out what was going on.

Not just finding them interesting, amusing, wonderful and touching, but really caring about them, as though they were actual people, a part of my life. Ms. Feehan weaves such a powerful spell sometimes I have to remind myself it's not real.

I highly recommend it to anyone who might be interested in a Gothic historical.

050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Excellent Non-Carpathian Novel,"While I am not usually a fan of books where the hero is overly domineering, I must concede that Christine Feehan writes so well that I enjoy her novels even though the men are so controlling and obsessive it would be frightening in real life.&quot;The Scarletti Curse&quot; is not a part of the Carpathian series, but I found myself enjoying it as much, if not more. The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself, she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately, the one man she wishes to hide this talent from, Giovanni Scarletti, is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work, the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine, it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with &quot;Lair of the Lion.&quot; This novel is much, much better. If you like her Carpathian series, or are interested in paranormal romance, this is a good book to read.",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Exciting gothic story line,"No female, whether they are of the blood or through marriage, survives THE SCARLETTI CURSE. They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still, she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However, the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass, suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies, but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale, this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her ""Dark"" series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner",positive
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),5.0,Gothic danger and passionate love -- Very highly recommended,"The ancient dons worshipped the old gods, honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed, and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed, the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta, a woman who is known to be &quot;different&quot; in her gifts to heal, to listen to the wind, to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride, Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her, but when she fled her home to hide, the don followed her, luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice, erotic and seductive, entices her imagination and her womanhood, linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife, as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work, I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions, and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style, a deep understanding for history, and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism, THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning, including the dark castle with gargoyles, warnings from natural elements, portents from ravens, secret passageways, family secrets, and multiple dead wives. Further, the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings, while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow. Very highly recommended.",positive

But a still more fearful secret lurked within its storm-tossed turrets. For every bride who entered its forbidding walls was doomed to leave in a casket.Mystical and unfettered, Nicoletta had no terror of ancient curses and no fear of marriage...until she looked into the dark, mesmerizing eyes of Don Scarletti. She had sworn no man would command her, had thought her gift of healing set her apart, but his was the right to choose a bride from among his people. And he had chosen her.Compelled by duty, drawn by desire, she gave her body into his keeping, and prayed the powerful, tormented Don would be her heart's destiny, and not her soul's demise.",positive

Heroine goes into spooky house - falls for tortured hero - danger lurks around every corner. I used to love this type of romance, but this one was extremely annoying! The plot was good, the hero and heroine were a good match, but I could not get past all the breaks in the sentences to inclue a couple of Italian words. It seemed that Ms. Feehan tried too hard to add that touch of Italian to every other sentence by putting in the two Italian words for my bother, my mother, my father, my grandfather, my grandmother. It was down right annoying to keep reading these few sets of words so frequently. It was very hard to keep the pace of reading the book when the sentences were broken up so often with the Italian. I have been a romance reading for over 20 years and have frequetnly read romance with touches of another language thrown in here and there, but this one was just to choppy for me to enjoy. I don't think I'll be inclined to buy another Feehan gothic unless I get the chance to skim it first. I will however keep reading her Dark series which I absolutely love.",negative
050552421X,The Scarletti Curse (Candleglow),3.0,Carpathian Lite,This book read a little too much like a toned down book from her Dark series for me to really enjoy it. Like the men in her other series the hero is laboring under a dark shadow and needs that special one woman to make his life light.

This was the first gothic novel I've read in quite some time. I must say that while the book was diverting, it was not one of my favorites by Feehan. I didn't find Nicoletta to be all that sympathetic. There were also a lot of minor characters with many names that the reader has to keep straight.Also, while Nicoletta's supernatural powers were explained pretty well, one never really gets to understand why Giovanni has them, or where they come from.But, all of that being said, it was creepy and certainly kept me reading.

B000O2E8PC,Principles of Biblical Interpretation (Sacred Hermeneutics),4.0,A Standard Work From Which To Start,"I am a Seminary instructor teaching a course called Principles of Biblical Interpretation. Obviously this book is part of the required reading. It is a 'standard' work by which I mean that it and a few others are considered to be baseline, required reading for anyone who wishes to advance beyond the elementary level in the field of hermeneutics.That said, I give it four stars because it is definitely not accessible by everyone. It is written for people who have a serious goal in mind and a disciplined study habit. It is not ""easy reading"" though it is well worth the effort. Further it is much more beneficial to those who have at least a working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew & Greek. In my class there are those who are entry level students (or auditors) who do not meet these criteria and I require them to read Berkhof but I augment the course with other books (""Reading the Bible With Heart & Mind"" by T. Longman, for one). This helps them advance with what they can get from Berkhof and reminds the more advanced students of their need to remain devotional in their Bible studies also.All in all, highly recommended for any reader as long as they understand what they are getting. You will be introduced to the various historical approaches to Biblical Interpretation (there are more than one you know), a sketch of a critique for each and a solid outline of how to build a more carefully crafted understanding of what the Bible teaches in your own reading.",positive
B000O2E8PC,Principles of Biblical Interpretation (Sacred Hermeneutics),4.0,Good summary of most important features,"I'm currently doing a course entitled ""Introduction to Biblical Interpretation"". This is one of the books I've read to help me come to terms with the material.This book appears to be based on a set of lecture notes prepared by Berhof for his students, more than having been written as a book from the beginning.I found its treatment of the various topics related to Biblical interpreation easy to follow, but covered in less depth than most other books. That said, I think what is said here would be sufficient for many people to come to terms with the core principles.At the end of many of the sections in the book are a list of references to other books and a set of questions. The questions seem to be based on the other works referenced, but I haven't been able to check as I don't have access to any of the cited works. Unfortunatly, due to the age of this text, many of the cited works are not longer in print.Many of the questions later on in the book are require you to apply the techniques covered to particular verses; no answers are provided, so it'd be useful for you to have someone who you can ask to check your answers.",positive

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),5.0,Plenty of Twists and Turns,"First off, let me say that although all of Cornwell's thrillers stand alone, it's better if you read them in the order they were written. More so in PC's case than in other authors who continue with the same character, book after book. This is because PC does the impossible, she keeps her characters continually growing with each story. Pass one up and you miss some of their development and the very interesting, but very flawed people that walk through the pages of her books are like people we know, friends, and one should stay current with one's friends.""Cruel and Unusual"" opens with Kay waiting for the execution of murder/rapist Ronnie Joe Waddell, but even as she's waiting someone is being killed, the killer using Waddell's M.O. One of his finger prints even shows up at one of the crime scenes.This book has the usual Cornwellian twists and turns and as usual I was glued to my seat as I read this five star novel. I loved every second of it, because nobody does Cornwell, like Cornwell.",positive
B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),3.0,Woah- what happened between All That Remains and Cruel & Unusual?? Too many plot holes,"Who is Dr. Kay Scarpetta? Let her tell you:""I was a physician with a law degree. I had been trained to know what gave life and what took it, what was right and what was wrong. Then experience had become my mentor, wiping its feet on that pristine part of myself that was idealistic and analytical. It is disheartening when a thinking person is forced to admit that many cliches are true. There is no justice on this earth. Nothing would ever undo what Ronnie Joe Waddell had done."" (p. 6)Scarpetta is a the medical examiner and Waddell, recently executed inmate, is her latest case. The Waddell case won't be so easy, and it turns out his prints are showing up at crimes during and after his execution. Was the wrong person executed? Waddell's prints are in ""the system"". Speaking of systems, who broke into Scarpetta's computer? And why are her two employees, Ben and Susan, acting strangely? On top of this, Scarpetta has to ""babysit"" her sidekick and her niece. Her sidekick, Pete Marino, is a cop who can't get over the end of his marriage. With bad health habits and a sour disposition, Scarpetta has to constantly remind Marino to watch out for himself. And her niece, Lucy, has gone from being a fat little kid to a thin, super intelligent math and science whiz. Lucy is now a bratty 17- year old with a terrible attitude. But hey, she can help Scarpetta with the computer, so it's worth having Lucy around! (I think Lucy is supposed to be annoying- it makes her more realistic.)So, it appears Scarpetta has to figure out why Waddell's prints are appearing at new crimes and why other people are being murdered. Simple enough, right? Yes, but it doesn't stay simple. Cornwell makes the plot extremely hole-ridden with little sidetracks. Scarpetta's missing her lover, Mark James. She's trying to make amends with flakey morgue attendant Susan Story. Professionally, Scarpetta's in A LOT of trouble, and the government nor the media will give her space. She also has to deal with the families of the deceased, who move in and out of the story, sometimes reappearing, and sometimes disappearing into thin air. These details bog down what could be an excellent thriller.What I do like - the vivid descriptions of Virginia winters. Completely spot on, and it makes me look forward to a break in my current sticky, summer weather. :)The medical procedures are described in detail - electric chair executions, autopsies, fatal gun shot wounds, etc.Again, though, Cornwell does ""too much of a good thing"" by getting overly technical with the description of Robyn Naismith's/Sam Potter's residence. As for the mysterious feathers, again, too much detail is given to the what, where, why and how's of orinthology. Too many pages devoted to the types of feathers in down. Bo-ring!This is an average read. I am not encouraging you to run to your local bookstore, because it would be a total waste of money. When you have time, and space on your library card account, check out this book. BUT, do not make it your first Scarpetta novel, because it will turn you away from the series!",neutral

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),3.0,"Excellent first half, unfocussed and over-the-top second half","'Cruel And Unusual' won Patricia Cornwell the CWA's Gold Dagger award, suggesting that those in the know regard it as her best Scarpetta book. I'm not so sure. The first half is excellent, raising the baffling and unsettling prospect of a killer committing murders from Beyond The Grave. But I feel the book badly loses focus in the second half, resulting in a rushed and somewhat anti-climactic conclusion.Note that this book sets up a story thread through the next two books, so you must read this before tackling 'The Body Farm' and 'From Potters Field'.To the story itself: convicted murderer Ronnie Waddell has just been executed. But when a young boy is found murdered in a strikingly similar fashion, Scarpetta, Marino and Wesley are forced to consider a number of disturbing possibilites. Is there a copycat killer? Or was the wrong man sentenced to the chair? This part of the book is well written, with a strong focus on the forensic science, as well as a study of Waddell himself and the crime he allegedly committed. But when another ""copycat"" killing turns up Waddell's fingerprint, things take a very bizzare twist.Here is where the book loses me. Instead of considering more logical possibilities about how a dead man's fingerprint might have got somewhere, Scarpetta and Co jump to the most extraordinary conclusion. The idea that Waddell could (a) convince another person to go to the chair for him, and (b) organise smuggling the imposter in and himself out, is ridiculous. Also, the latter part of the book is increasingly taken up with an investigation into Scarpetta herself, dragging her into court on the flimsiest of ""evidence"". Cornwell really lets her poor-woman-persecuted-by-evil-sexist-men theme go over the top here. Arrogant oaf Patterson may be, but to pin a multiple murder on Scarpetta? It's silly.The end result is that the conclusion to the book is incredibly rushed. It literally takes place within the last few pages, and is based on little more than a sudden hunch from Scarpetta. Combined with the fact that the finale is deliberately open-ended, the whole thing comes across as a huge anti-climax. While it does provide the perfect lead-in to 'The Body Farm', as a stand-alone ending I can only remember how cheated I felt when I first read the book.So in all, a great beginning that's let down by a confused and unfocussed conclusion. The central plot is clever and the investigation is interesting, but it's disappointing Cornwell seems to lose the thread of the story badly in the second half.[3.5 stars].",neutral

It was great to backtrack and discover what has become one of my favorite books in the series. The story is SO imaginative and original! The suspense is taut and kept me on the edge of my seat. And most of all, there is Kay, a three dimensional, refreshingly human heroine. No, she isn't perfect. As the possibility of an affair with a married man arose, I wasn't &quot;appalled&quot; by Kay, I was heartbroken for her. Driven by work, shattered by lost love, reaching for someone to bring her back to life emotionally ... her feelings may not be noble but they certainly seemed human to me. A powerful woman in a controversial, conventionally male field, and reviewers ask why so many people hate her? It seems very realistic that the head of a high-profile state agency would find herself with enemies. While I have no real criticism of this book, I do have a comment on the rest of the series. Part of why I enjoyed this one so much is Lucy. As the series progresses, Lucy's life gets so complicated and convulated and dangerous that it is her character, not Kay's, that strains credibility.

Very choppy and alot to adjust too. Where is Abby?If Kay is so likeable, how is it she had so many enemies? THis is where I get off the series.

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),5.0,solid Scarpetta police procedural,"Henrico County, Virginia Detective Joe Trent calls the state Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta because of a situation involving thirteen year old Eddie Heath shot in the head with potential sexual components involved. At the same time the Commonwealth executes Ronnie Joe Waddell convicted of the murder of anchorwoman Robyn Naismith ten years earlier on evidence founded by Scarpetta.Scarpetta's autopsy of Heath uncovers the fingerprint of Waddell on the corpse. As anti capital punishment lawyer Grueman turns up the heat with the media claiming Scarpetta is incompetent, files are stolen from her office. More murders that apparently were committed by a dead Waddell lead Grueman orchestrating the press even further that perhaps the smoking gun of capital punishment has occurred, an innocent person executed. Other evidence against Scarpetta leads to a grand jury investigation into the possible criminal activities of the medical examiner.CRUEL AND UNUSUAL is a solid Scarpetta police procedural in which the beleaguered heroine is struggling to understand how a dead man could be murdering people and what happened to her once thriving career. The story line is filled with twists and turns that makes sense afterward but will surprise the reader while the grand jury inquiry is insightful and a bit shocking for instance the ""defense"" cannot bring in witnesses. Patricia Cornwell provides a strong Scarpetta thriller with the star in jeopardy of more than just her livelihood going down the tubes.Harriet Klausner",positive

Cruel and Unusual, however, was not her best piece by a longshot, but seemed to be more of a 'filler' segment in the ongoing saga of Kay Scarpetta, medical examiner extraordinaire. As a scientist and hopefully a doctor in the future, I find the tone of the author to be condescending to the average reader's knowledge of science and forensics in general, however. I think enough Discovery Channel crime shows would cover the same material she describes over and over again.

The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the &quot;who&quot; of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing.

Very strange occurrences continue to happen, including the fingerprint of Waddell showing up in the next murder victim's home and a morgue supervisor being killed by the same gun that killed Eddie Heath. The confusion that envelops Kay Scarpetta adds to the drama of this book, as she wonders if the wrong man was executed. Could it be a simple case of mistaken identity? You can bet that nothing is simple when Patricia Cornwell is creating the story line and developing it!Just when the reader thinks he/she has figured everything out, Patricia Cornwell adds another dip in the road and makes you rethink the entire list of events. Cornwell keeps you guessing until the end, and does so with a flare that is unique and thrilling. It's interesting to see just how many questions about a crime that Scarpetta can answer (and you can keep up with) without overloading the reader's brain. Cornwell seems to have that fine line gauged properly, as she never over-burdens the reader but instead keeps them entertained and intrigued until the last page.

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),4.0,Interesting book to read during the holidays!,"This is only the second of the author's &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot; novels that I've read, and I wasn't all that impressed with _Postmortem,_ so I approached this fourth book in the series with some scepticism, even though It seems to be one of the best reviewed. After a decade of appeals, Ronnie Joe Waddell is finally being executed and Scarpetta waits to perform the autopsy (though I'm not clear why that should be necessary). But that same evening, a young boy is ritually murdered in a manner very reminiscent of Waddell's style. That's followed by another murder -- and Waddell's fingerprints apparently are found on the scene. Was someone else executed in his place? The authorities involved, of course, don't even want to *think* about such an appalling possibility. More murders follow, including Scarpetta's own Morgue Attendant, and suddenly links seem to be turning up to tie the Chief Medical Examiner to the killings, as well as to corruption in her own office. All the action takes place in the few weeks preceding and following the Christmas-New Year's holidays, and the gray, cold winter adds greatly to the flavor of the narration.There's no question that this one is an improvement over the first one I read. Cornwell doesn't bring in a completely new character in the last chapter to be the villain, for one thing. And she has added considerable depth to the personalities of all the repeating characters, especially Lt. Pete Marino of Richmond Homicide and FBI Special Agent Benton Wesley. My favorite, though, is Lucy, Scarpetta's niece from Miami, who possesses what another character calls a &quot;frightening intellect.&quot; But she's still seventeen years old, and her home life is, in many ways, not a happy one. Aunt Kay really does try to be the friend and confident to Lucy that she would like to be, but she has her own emotional problems -- not least among them the death of her lover in an IRA bombing in London less than a year before -- and her naturally reserved and somewhat stony personality is sometimes her own worst liability.There are problems, though. Cornwell has a rather pompous style, especially when she's describing the latest crime-fighting technological advances, or the ins and outs of UNIX. It's as if she enjoys saying &quot;I know more about this than you do.&quot; She also indulges in irritating word-choices, such as not knowing the difference between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; (e.g., &quot;I put my revolver inside my purse&quot;), and she seems to be unaware of the use of contractions in ordinary speech. Still, the well thought out plot and the complications in possible motives and interpretations kept me reading. Many fans and reviewers take it as a given that Cornwell is the &quot;best&quot; mystery writer working, which I can't agree with at all. But she's not bad.",positive

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),4.0,Good read but a little too technical for mere mortal!,"I quite enjoyed this book and found myself mystified throughout as to ""whodunnit"". In that sense it was a really good read and delivered the suspense it promised. I usually enjoy Patricia's books and like the way she builds a profile of her heroine's life, including the people she is close to as well as those more on the periphery of her life - it helps the reader to relate to her and treat her as a real person. I particularly like the way she combines her professional life with her personal one and think it shows the human side which is very necessary considering her profession which could otherwise seem very detached and clinical so well done for that consideration. The plot was complex but not too much so and very cleverly thought out. The only reason I didn't find it unputdownable was because for me the over usage of technical jargon got in the way too much. Most people not familiar with the terminology will probably find it irritating - after all, who wants to have to refer to a medical directory to understand what's being said! I have heard many others make a similar comment but personally I never found it a bother in her other books but on this occasion I was quite exasperated. A small quibble and I wouldn't let it put me off.",positive
B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),3.0,Dissatisfying,"Ronnie Joe Waddell, who's been on death row for nearly a decade for a vicious murder, is executed, and Kay Scarpetta is called on to perform an autopsy on his body. At least, she thinks it's his body. On the same day of Waddell's execution, another murder occurs--this one eerily similar to the one committed nine years ago. When the killer strikes again--this time, murdering one of Scarpetta's morgue assistants--Scarpetta quickly finds herself accused of committing the crime herself. Is it a copycat killer? Or has Waddell escaped his punishment? The plot is complex, and this works both for and against the book. The story sometimes so bizarre, so complex, that the reader can't help but keep turning the pages. On the other hand, the plot is so convoluted that the reader may lose track of what's going on. Although readers may agree that everything fits together in the end, they may still be feeling a little confused. In addition to this, Cornwell throws several plot elements at the reader that take the reader completely by surprise--and not in a good way. For example, Scarpetta is in the middle of the investigation when she suddenly recalls that a significant love interest has been killed in a terrorist attack several months before the story actually begins. This is certainly news to any reader who has read this book's predecessor, All That Remains, which concludes with the love interest still very much alive. So much is happening between the books that it just doesn't seem fair to the reader, not to mention sloppiness on the author's part. Cornwell would have done better to give the love story subplot more attention in the story, since it later plays a vital role in Scarpetta's exoneration. Overall, Cruel and Unusual works as a crime novel, but still leaves the reader somewhat dissatisfied at the end.",neutral

Meanwhile all is not well is Dr Scarpetta's office.

It's the first of Cornwell's books I have read and it leaves me feeling pretty well-disposed to the prospect of reading one or two more.

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),4.0,This is a great addition to the Scarpetta series,"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books and have enjoyed most of them quite a bit. Cruel and Unusual is one of the best in the series in my opinion. I say this because Cornwell is at her best when she quietly piles on the tension factor. Cornwell at her worst is when she feels the need to multiply the body count via the worlds evilest serial killer ala James Patterson. Sadly, after 'Cruel and Unusual', Cornwell starts in on several books that just go further and further out on a limb of insanity. Happily for you the reader, if you have not read this book yet, you are in for a very entertaining yarn from Cornwells best period.The plot here is fairly complicated and its hard to describe much of it without giving away some of the earlier surprises. So I will suffice to say that it starts out when Scarpetta is called in to do an autopsy on a recently executed death row inmate. However, it quickly becomes apparent that something is not quite right. A couple of days earlier a young lad had been killed in much the same manner as the death row inmate and soon it looks like the executed man somehow might not have been the right person put to death. Instead the death row guy might be out on the street knocking off victims once again. How did this happen?Also, Scarpetta is dragged into a series of questions to answer when files start to go missing in her office and something or other is amuck.I hope you read this book.

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),4.0,Lots of loose ends.,"I really like both this author and her popular heroine Dr. Kay Scarpetta because of the maturity of the character in addition to the stoicism that is displayed by her cool and collected manner. She is the ultimate professional. This book ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not up to the author's personal standards set in other books such as ""Trace"" which is one of the very best she has written to date.I have spent the past 10 minutes rereading parts of this book and am still confused by the mishmash ending. I don't have a real clue what happened to the bad guys here. Where is the ravening beast convict who was released from prison and resulted in a number of unsolved murders as one example? There is a lot of personal stuff to soften and ""humanize"" the image of Dr. Scarpetta, but even with the snarky neice Lucy with her smart alecky mouth, there is still the steely and distant feel to Dr. Scarpetta. I like that a lot.IMO, the absolute worst thing an author can do to a strong female character is to make her suddenly get ""melting bones"" or those insipid hormonal storms, a la the Nora Roberts style, et al, that stimulate their ""broody"" instincts at the first sight of an acceptable male and the next topic becomes gooey babies and sucky conversations with relatives rather than science and focus and dedication to one's career that makes for a tight, fascinating and worthwhile read.So, with that in mind, this book gets a 4 pointer simply because Ms. Cornwell avoids the ""romance-crime drama"" pitfalls and forges ahead with a decent, albeit patchy and vague story. I am glad that the author has also forged ahead in her craft and her subsequent stories are sooooo much better than this one.",positive

B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),3.0,What if the death row criminal hadn't died?,"Another test drive into the world of mystery, this book is my first book written by Patricia Cornwall.Life as a medical examiner isn't easy for Kay Scarpetta, particularly when fingerprints of a man killed in the electric chair appear at the scene of a crime a few days after he was killed. Then, after the death of her assistant, Susan Story, Kay becomes implicated in the crime. Can she discover the true killer before she ends up either in jail or dead herself?What I Liked:First off, I enjoyed Cornwell's writing style. She writes with intelligence and detail, brining you into the very scene. The autopsies, the attention to detail (particularly in relation to Eddie and Jennifer), the thorough regard for the scenery all made it very easy to transport myself to Virginia with Dr. Scarpetta.Further, the story was pretty interesting and left you guessing. When I opened the book, I would have had no clue of the outcome, which was surprising (if, in a sense, a little disappointing as well). Several seemingly unrelated people die, but somehow Cornwall is able to tie their deaths in at the very end.My favorite characters included Benton Wesley, Marino, and, of course, Kay. Benton was an intelligent man, kind and someone Kay could turn to. But he almost held an aristocratic air. Marino, on the other hand, was more down to earth. I enjoyed his arguing with Lucy and how the gruff man ended up coming to Christmas to Kay's after all. Finally, I grew fond of Kay. At first, I found her hard to approach, but then I realized that was her personality anyway. As the story progressed, I felt I got more of a handle on who she was and what she wanted. Further, I enjoyed how she paid attention to detail and thought things through logically.What I Did Not Like:Now, this could be due to my taking a month longer than I should have to finish this book, but I felt the story was slow (but not in an obvious ""Will this book ever end?"" fashion). I was plugging along and realized, ""Hm, I'm halfway through and still have no clue how the heck this is going to end"". This is not necessarily bad, but I would certainly not classify this book as one of those racing thrillers that keeps you on the edge of your seat every moment.My biggest complaint has to be the character of Lucy. She is probably the most annoying character in the book. Her selfish, bratty whining made me wish frequently she would go home. Her actual purpose in the book was so small, I have no idea why she was included for most of it! All she did was discover the message left in Kay's computer and that AFIS had been corrupted. I felt that Cornwall was repetitively shoving Lucy away because she was in the way (sending her to ski with Benton's wife, having her left home alone while Kay ran around doing errands, etc.). And I have a hard time believing that a 17 year old could be such a computer brainiac. I think the story would have been much better without her.Lastly, I felt the ending was rather rushed, the story concluding rather hastily in the last 10 pages or so, almost as if Cornwall was being pushed to get the story done and hurriedly threw the last bits together.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Dialogue is relatively tame, considering the genre. A few d***, h***, ba*****, and some wandering appearances of the f-word.Lucy complains about her mother's promiscuity and asks Kay if her aunt will have an affair. Kay's lover is brought up. Marino goes home with a woman after a Christmas party.Finally, three people are killed in the course of this book (well, more if you count Waddell, the death row criminal, and his victim). The autopsies describe the injuries, which can make the squeamish squeam. Also an explosion is described in retrospect.Overall:My first thought at finishing this is ""Ho-hum"". ""Cruel and Unusual"" is not really a bad book. It is well written and fairly interesting. I just felt that parts drug more than they should and really couldn't stand certain nameless (LUCY!) characters. 3 stars.Brought to you by*C.S. Light*",neutral

The book is a must-read for those addicted to Cornwell's well-researched suspense novels, since it sets the stage for a showdown in From Potter's Field. But a major plot hole revealed in the first few pages leaves the reader feeling cheated for the remainder of the novel.We enter the story with Scarpetta recovering from the death of a close friend. While this development certainly bodes well for future plot twists, it leaves the reader frustrated with the current one. The few details of the death surface mostly at the end of the story and while we're told of Scarpetta's devastation, we really don't witness it. Seasoned Cornwell fans are accustomed to these shallow depths in characterization but it nonetheless puts a damper on an otherwise entertaining mystery.",neutral
B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),2.0,One bad egg is forgiveable,"This is the worst of the Scarpetta series. which is quite an achievement seeing as all the others are brilliant. My favourites being the claustrophobic &quot;The Body Farm&quot;, and the superbly dark &quot;Point of Origin&quot;. I have loved all the Scarpetta's, and read them at least twice over, and i still think this is the worst.The plot was very complicated, and it all seemed a bit of a mess. The characters were nothing special, and i this is the only book in which Cornwell manage to bore me with her normally insightful computer terminology. It's too long, and basically i dont think it has any substance. There is a great potential. The idea for the plot is superb, and could well have been one of the best, but somewhere along the line it all slips. I cant put my finger on it, but i just didnt come away from this with the satisfaction i normally get out of a Kay Scarpetta book.Nevertheless this is still a necessary book to read if you intend to read the entire series. It is one of the major turning points. The first book to feature Temple Gault, who would later lead to Carrie Grethen, Newton Joyce, and all the other catastrophic events which culminate in the next turning point of &quot;The Last Precint&quot;. each one has signalled a new era for Patricia Cornwell, and each one has not been quite as good as the others. But The Last Precint was still much better than this. It is, admittedly, very clever, but far too complicated, and im surprised it got the CWA's gold dagger.nevertheless, i have given it two stars purely because it is such a major point in Scarpetta's life. You must read it if you intend to read the entire series, but dont expect to enjoy it as much as you do the others.",negative

I love the idea of having a fingerprint from a recently-executed criminal show up at a new crime scene. And I love how they determine throughout the whirling pace of the book how this could be possible and who the real killer is. Great ending, superb characters and dialogue. Cornwell is a mistress of her field and has great credentials -- having worked for a medical investigator -- to boot! Anyone who hasn't read this book should drop everything they're doing and read it.",positive
B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),3.0,Cornwell's Magic,"Dr. Kay Scarpetta is in it up to her neck this time. A death row inmate, Waddle, is executed, but before his body is even cool, murdered corpses start piling up with Waddle's fingerprints found at the scene of the crime. Next thing you know, people are dropping like flies, some of them close to Dr. Kay, and she is publicly implicated in the deaths.Cornwell has written a workably entertaining mystery here. The plot is engaging and bubbling with intrigue, and the writing isn't hampered by too much extraneous detail or incidental goings-ons. There is a subplot with Kay's niece, Lucy, that I found a tad ingratiating and annoying, but for anyone reading the Scarpetta mysteries in order, it is an understandable and rather necessary bit of character development.I do, however, object to Cornwell relegating some of the more serious character development to the back story. I'm talking about the sudden death of Kay's long-time love interest, Mark, (and, to a lesser extent, her decision to quit smoking). These are pretty significant events in Kay's life, and to leave them in the background as part of the story dressing seems at odds with an author who wants us to sympathize with her character.To that end, some of the story ended up either ringing false to me, or just falling flat. For example, there is much made of Kay's financial secrets, which she refers to in connection with embarassment and rage. When the secrets are finally revealed, I found them to be maudlin and a little silly. It baffled me why Kay would take such pains to keep them hidden.Furthermore, I respect Cornwell's decision to keep her novels secured solely in the Holmesian realm of mystery solving, but this means that there is very little action in the book, and a lot of key details are discussed and reviewed over and over again by the characters. It makes for repetitive reading. It also means that the actual discovery of the culprit's identity is never as important as the sleuthing that went into discovering that identity.In other words, if you're looking for closure with this story, you won't get much. Cornwell does a great job of setting up quite a puzzler, and it will keep you guessing. But, much like a magician with an amazing magic trick, once you learn the secret, you're bound to be a little disappointed.",neutral
B000MCKQRS,Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),3.0,Cliffhanger,"First of all, this book really should receive 3.5 stars, but due to the lack of &quot;half-stars&quot; in Amazon.com's rating system, a mere three will have to do. This is my fifth Patricia Cornwell book, but definitely is not my favorite. The plot was terrific--the idea of a death row inmate possibly escaping from prison is a frightening concept, especially since Cornwell is always right on the ball when it comes to accuracy of details. As always, the characters are so realistic that the reader often must test himself to remember that they are indeed fictional. This book got a five star rating from me until about halfway when political injustices against the main character intervened. Although this was a good idea for a plot twist, it seemed that Cornwell was digressing from the main idea of the story, taking the reader into another story completely separate from what we read in the beginning. The ending was a disappointment--throughout the story, Cornwell is setting the reader up for the usual great climax where the perpetrator is discovered and captured and all is well--and then, it doesn't happen. In my opinion, it seemed like the ending was written by not Cornwell, but another author who rushed to complete this chapter of Kay Scarpetta's adventures as soon as possible. Overall, Cruel and Unusual was a good book that unfortunately could have been a great book if the right elements had been present.",neutral

The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw.",negative

An executed inmate's fingerprints turn up at another crime scene. How could this possibly happen? Perhaps he's still alive, having been switched with another inmate instead of dying himself.

What passed for character development was more like being beat over the head with a ten-pound hammer: we know that Kay is cold and detached, that Lucy needs to be loved, and so on. I knew it the first time Cornwell told me. To tell -- not show -- me again and again, always in the same exact way, the same conversations, made me roll my eyes with boredom. Plus, the characters were so one-dimensional, I just didn't care.Ultimately, though, you read a mystery novel for the mystery, and I just didn't find it that interesting.

I have read two others (Cause of Death and Black Notice) before this one, but this is my favorite of the three. Cruel and Unusual contains elements found in the other Scarpetta novels (difficult conversations with her mother and sister, major neuroses revolving around her niece, Lucy, internal plots hatched to ruin Scarpetta, and expecting Pete Marino to drop dead from his excesses at any second), but not to the point where I found the repetition annoying. If anything, I want to see more of these familiar characters. The autopsy details seemed less excessive and the pace was quicker.Cruel and Unusual begins with the execution of a rapist/murderer, and the following autopsy of the felon. Shortly thereafter, a string of seemingly unconnected murders erupt around Richmond. Scarpetta finds one common strand - all appear to be committed by the supposedly dead convict. As if this isn't bad enough, her assistant is murdered and the press indicts Scarpetta.As always, Cornwell's knowledge of forensic medicine and the law were put to good use.

B000890HE2,Gaston de Blondeville (The modern novelists),5.0,Mrs. Radcliffe: First Lady of Historical Fiction,"Valancourt Books' recent publication of Mrs. Radcliffe's Gaston de Blondeville is a publication long overdue. The novel, originally published in 1826, three years after the mistress of the Gothic's death, was actually written by her in 1803, but then suppressed by her from publication. The general belief is that she disowned the novel, thinking it inferior to her other work; literary historians have also claimed that readers agreed and greeted its publication with little enthusiasm. The primary reason usually given for why it is inferior is that it is the only one of Radcliffe's Gothic novels where she chose to use a real ghost rather than explain what appeared to be supernatural occurrences. The general reader, and especially the student of Gothic and historical fiction, should be allowed to judge the matter for himself and now that Valancourt Books has republished Gaston de Blondeville, that decision can be made.Gaston de Blondeville, while admittedly not as full of chills and suspense as The Mysteries of Udolpho or The Italian, is a remarkable novel in Radcliffe's canon. It marks a noted departure from her earlier novels, and in many ways, it displays her growth and restraint as an author. Considering all her previous novels were published between the time she was twenty-five and thirty-three, a remarkably young age for someone to write three of the greatest Gothic novels of all time, as well as a couple inferior ones, it is not surprising that Radcliffe sought to move in a new direction in her work. Gaston de Blondeville was the beginning of her growth in that new direction, and had she written another like it, readers may have had a real treat in an even greater Radcliffe.My only criticism of Valancourt Books' edition of Gaston de Blondeville--which is filled with a superb collection of secondary sources and an impressive scholarly introduction by Frances Chiu to reflect the historical and political influences of the French Revolution upon the novel--is that no attempt is made in these supplementary materials to explain why Radcliffe made this departure from her past use of rational explanations for supposed supernatural occurrences. I believe that departure is the big question that must be answered about this novel, especially since Radcliffe was otherwise striving to be more realistic from a historical standpoint.Despite what is typically said about Gaston de Blondeville by literary historians, the six contemporary reviews provided in this edition are largely favorable. In her introduction, Frances Chiu quotes these reviews to argue that literary critics condemned the novel, but in truth, only one review is solidly negative while the rest express great enthusiasm for a new work by Mrs. Radcliffe. Chiu quotes La Belle Assemblee as saying ""it is without the lofty pretensions of some of Mrs. Radcliffe's earlier productions, and incapable of exciting an equal intenseness of interest"" but Chiu fails to quote what comes directly after: ""it will not in the slightest degree detract from the fame of her"" and ""it will be read with great satisfaction by every reader of taste."" Scots Magazine was pleased that the novel does not include so much of her poetry which is not remarkable at all, and overall feels the novel is an improvement on her earlier work because ""She avoided long particulars of rural scenery, and tedious trackings of the agitated mind, from one terrible or sorrowful imagination to another."" In fact, the only review that is truly negative is the Monthly Review, which does find parts of the work to praise but chiefly objects to its use of the supernatural.Why Radcliffe decided to include supernatural events as a reality has not been given a good explanation. Perhaps she felt the supernatural was more acceptable to the reading public by the earlier nineteenth century, nearly fifteen years after she wrote her first Gothic novel. While she may have been in competition with other Gothic writers, her contemporaries, such as Matthew Lewis in The Monk (1795) and William Godwin in St. Leon (1799), were not beyond using the supernatural as a possibility, so perhaps she need no longer provide rational explanations for supernatural events. Greater study is needed of how the view toward the supernatural changed and became acceptable in literature, especially during this period as the ""Age of Reason"" was replaced by the horrors of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.What I find more remarkable about Gaston de Blondeville than Radcliffe's use of the supernatural is that it is one of the earliest historical fiction novels. Sir Walter Scott is often credited with being the first major writer of historical fiction, but historical fiction certainly has its roots in Gothic novels with their typically medieval settings. The difference between Gothic and historical fiction is the concentration on a much more realistic historical world. The Gothic typically sets its novels in a more vaguely historical period or avoids attention to historic detail. A key component to historical fiction is the depiction of historical events and historical personages in the background of the novel, such as the Battle of Culloden as the background to Scott's Waverley (1814). If that is true, then I would argue that Radcliffe is our first true female historical novelist since Gaston de Blondeville, although not published until 1826, was written in 1803, a full six years before Jane Porter's The Scottish Chiefs (1809), that tremendous novel about Sir William Wallace, and only three years after Godwin's St. Leon (1799) which only really attains historical fiction status due to its including the historical character of Bethlem Gabor in its pages. (Arguments have been made that Clara Reeve is the first female writer of historical fiction, but I don't feel her work is historically detailed enough to merit such a claim). Radcliffe is far more historically detailed than Godwin in her descriptions of the court of Henry III and in the details she provides of that age of chivalry, tournaments, and medieval monasteries. While her novel may not have had the influence on historical fiction that Scott's works did, and therefore, she may not be the mother of historical fiction, not having led to the birth of similar historical works, as she was for Gothic novels, she certainly is the aunt, who has been kept like a skeleton in the closet, while Gaston de Blondeville has been treated as if it were better not to be talked about it, lest it ruin the Mistress of Gothic Literature's good name.I encourage all lovers of Gothic and historical fiction to read Gaston de Blondeville to make up their own minds. I personally find the novel a much more concise, controlled and mature work, and if not as fascinating and suspenseful as her previous works, one that deserves further attention. If Mrs. Radcliffe had written and published a couple more historical novels after Gaston de Blondeville, I have no doubt she would have rivaled Sir Walter Scott for his dominant place as a writer of historical fiction. As always, I commend Valancourt Books for preserving our literary heritage by printing such important and overlooked works of literature.- Tyler R.

Festivities abound, wine flows copiously, and spirits are high as the King and his subjects prepare to celebrate the nuptials of Sir Gaston de Blondeville. But the joyous mood is interrupted when a merchant, Hugh Woodreeve, comes distraught before the King to demand justice. His kinsman, he claims, was murdered, by the very man the King has come to honour -- Gaston de Blondeville!Suspecting a conspiracy against Gaston, yet obliged to hold a trial to determine the truth of the allegations, Henry imprisons Woodreeve in a tower while awaiting a hearing. Meanwhile, sinister forces are at work, represented by an evil abbot, who will stop at nothing to ensure the truth behind Woodreeve's claims is never revealed.As the trial unfolds and the danger mounts for both Woodreeve and Gaston, a mysterious figure will come from beyond the grave to elucidate the horrible mystery!The only one of Radcliffe's novels to feature a real ghost, Gaston de Blondeville was published posthumously in 1826. This edition, the first-ever scholarly edition of the novel, features a new introduction by Frances Chiu, uncoding the novel's long-hidden political, historical, and religious contexts.

0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,4.0,Tremendously entertaining mixture of fable and wisdom,"This is a very entertaining tale of a clever cyncial rabbi's cat on the surface. However, the tale goes much further than exploring the cat's desire to anthropomorphise. It deals with father-daughter relationships, love, obedience, the stiffling influence of tradition, clashes between cultures, etc. It is uniquely influenced by Jewish theological exegesis and rabbinical commentary. Moreso than Will Eisner's work which was a landmark in this area (also on Amazon).I liked the artwork in the main. Panels are loosely framed on the pages which gives a light flow to the narrative. Colours are strong and mediterranean when needs be. I have two reservations however. Firstly, some of the pieces are overdrawn. Too much unnecessary detail in a scene. Text in the speech bubbles is squeezed at times and as a middle aged person with spectacles I found it hard to read on occasion. My reading wuld have been easier if overall frame size was bigger. Secondly, and this is my major reservation, the whole tale is told primarily through language used by the characters rather than through the characters actions. In other words as a graphic novel, I thought it was too wordy. You may well observe, that it is ironic that a graphic novel based around the culture of the 'people of the Book' repeats the textual propensity of much Jewish self-commentary. Eisner, to my mind, has the text-visual balance better defined. However, these are personal aesthetic opinions and shouldn't detract from the overall conceptual achievement which is exemplary.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,A wonderful & enlightening book.,"This is a one-volume, hard-cover, adult graphic novel about a Rabbi's cat who gets the power to speak. This novel was originally published in France, in three volumes, spread over three years. It's a wonderful book.By the way, Joann is a guy's name, in France. Maybe, it's an old French spelling of John or Jean. According to the book's jacket blurb, Sfar is one of the ""brightest and most talented of the younger generation of French comic artists."" He has written or collaborated on over one hundred books for adults & children. Sfar received the prestigious Jury Award at Angouleme for The Rabbi's Cat.This book will be enlightening for most people & especially for most Jewish-Americans. The three connected stories are about Algerian Jews in the 1930s, in both Algeria & France. My knowledge of this area of Jewish life & history is negligible. IThe cat in this book gains the power of speech by eating & swallowing the family's pet parrot. The cat ends up having theological & philosophical discussions with the Rabbi. The cat wants to study Kabbalah & get Bar Mitzvahed. They debate both Western thought & Jewish thought.Through the cat's eyes we listen in on the discussions of the Rabbi's students. We learn who are studious & who are vain, arrogant & self-important. We see the Rabbi turn to his own Master with his problems; but, through the cat's eyes we see this Master as less knowledgeable than his disciple. We see a Master who spouts foolishness because he knows of his own inferiority.We learn of the anti-Semitism faced by Jews in Algeria from the non-Jewish French settlers. Many of the Jews had been living in Algeria for centuries & had adopted Arab dress, food & customs. These Jews were turned away from French restaurants & other establishments. They usually felt more at home with the native Algerians; yet, always faced an undercurrent of nonacceptance. Even the French-Jewish establishment, centered in Paris, forced the leaders & Rabbis of the Algerian Jewish community to adapt to French ways, customs & speech. If such leaders & Rabbis couldn't pass demeaning grade school exams showing proficiency in French, they would be replaced; even though all native Algerian Jews spoke Hebrew & Arabic which had enabled them to get along quite well for those previous centuries.Through the cat's eyes we see the title Rabbi's struggle for acceptance by the French Jewish establishment. He is a great man in Algeria & is being considered for the post of Chief Rabbi. First he must pass this silly grade school exam. Readers see his agony & self-doubt. We see his complete joy at passing the exam & his own humbleness.We see friendship between himself & his Arab friends. We learn about Algerian Jews who have gone totally native, living like Nomadic warriors in the desert; at home with guns, knives & lions. We learn about the differences between Algerian Jews & French Jews in the pre-WWII period. We learn about street performers & Algerian Jews who must masquerade asArabs to make a living in France; as the French know almost nothing about Jews from Algeria who live like Arabs but are Jews.It's a wonderful book. There is much to learn about love, loyalty, marriage, family, hypocrisy, bravery, humbleness, friendship, loss, merriment, true riches, anti-Semitism and more. All of this is contained within less than 150 pages of a graphic novel, or what the French call, an adult comic book.",positive

0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,Judaism through a cat's lovingly irreverent eyes,"Why is this book different from all other books?It is one of the most creative works I have read, whether in the category of ethnic fiction, graphic novels or books about animals. I've never seen a book that so honestly discusses an insider's ambivalence about his culture, and from such an unusual perspective. Through the eyes of the Rabbi's cat, this graphic novel relates the story of a Rabbi in 1930s Algeria and France. The Rabbi faces many challenges in navigating his 3,500 year old faith and tradition as the modern world encroaches. He has spent much of his life studying the holy books and commentaries, which provide answers to many questions from cosmic theology to everyday existence. However, he continually encounters situations his religious education did not prepare him for--from his (talking) cat's unorthodox ideas about Judaism; to his cat's desire, unprecedented for an animal, to join the Jewish tribe; to a place the Rabbi visits that does not accommodate the pious Jewish way of life. In the end, the Rabbi faces these dilemmas and difficulties with a mind of his own, in contrast to other characters who either capitulate to secularism or withdraw into hard-line and often damaging religiosity. One of the book's themes is that love and dedication, whether to other people or even to a tradition as legalistic as Judaism's, may not always mean strict obedience. In this, the cat, who is willing to dare ""sacrilegious magic"" to try and help his beloved master, is a most compelling narrator. The cat watches with a sympathetic eye as the humans around him live, struggle and at times bend the rules.Although the prose contains many gems, Sfar's drawings leave something to be desired. In particular, the cat pictures mostly fail to capture a real feline's taciturn dignity, otherwordly softness and glowing-eyed, nocturnal mystique. The human facial expressions and body language, however, add subtleties that could not be achieved in other genres. The colorist, Brigitte Findakly, more than compensates for Sfar's shortcomings as an artist. With a bright, earthy palette, Findakly adds flavor to Sfar's Algeria and France, creating an inviting world for the reader to step into. Occasional profanity, sexual scenes and complicated themes may make _The Rabbi's Cat_ unsuitable for some young children; older children and adults should definitely read this fascinating and compelling book!Familiarity with Jewish theology, law and culture will enhance one's appreciation and understanding of _The Rabbi's Cat_. For a background in the book's cultural context, the curious may want to read _Judaism for Dummies_ or its counterparts in the _Idiot's Guide_ series; in addition, _Jews, God and History_ by Max I. Dimont is my favorite overview of Jewish history and would provide an excellent introduction to the historical context of _The Rabbi's Cat_. _Jews, God and History_ reveals that even before modern times, Judaism was almost never static--to the contrary, and like most healthy traditions, it has continually evolved and developed many historical branches as it adapted to its ever changing environment. Sadly, Jews were expelled from most Arab countries as the region's antisemitism increased in the mid-20th century; however, a world that approximates the Rabbi's might still exist in some Sephardic Jewish Modern Orthodox communities that maintain their traditions while accommodating secular culture. Chabad Lubavitch, a branch of basically traditional Judaism that originated in Eastern Europe, is a bit different but is much more open to answering questions and meeting with outsiders, complete with worldwide ""Chabad houses"" for the purpose. A moderate Judaism like the Rabbi's and an irreverent Judaism like his cat's can be found in the more progressive Conservative, Masorti, Reform, Reconstructionist and UK Liberal movements.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,What Does the Torah Say About Animals that Talk?,"As a Jewish American, I've always been fascinated by the experiences our people in the Diaspora. The lives of American, British, French, and Algerian Jews are all different. We can be found in the unlikeliest of places; Cuba, Mexico City, Rio, Mumbai, Dublin (I'm not joking, there are Jews in Ireland).I once boarded with a Jewish family in Strasbourg. Their lives were much different from those of New York Jews; they kept a lower profile, avoided gentiles, and their eating habits were more like those of their neighbors (no bagels, herring, or kugel on their table). British Jews, respectively, make a greater effort to appear ""English"" while avoiding non-Jews. You won't see cockneys eating in Jewish delis (not that I saw any Jewish delis in London aside from Bloom's).The Rabbi's Cat has a very quirky story that's not easy to summarize. A scrawny cat gains the power of speech and engages his master, a Rabbi, in debates. The Rabbis gorgeous daughter, having no interest in philosophy (and having no work to do) loves this cat as if he were an irritating younger sibling.Zlabya is your typical Arabian-Nights-Fantasy though she happens to be Jewish.

Or is he just too... full of life?I'm glad that graphic-novel fans will learn about the Jews of France thanks to this book. The Jews have been an important part of French society for years, but with the way things are going now, it may not last. Jews have been leaving France in greater number since 2001, and I hope they don't all leave for Israel, UK, or the USA.

I love his drawings and panels. They're loose, energetic, rich in texture and color, and impart the feel of the settings and the life-force of the characters. The dialogue is lively and smart. There's a lot going on in these stories connected by the presence of The Cat. The story and environments change; sometimes the characters are excited and welcoming of the changes and sometimes not. I hated to see one story line end, but then the next one would pick up and I would be carried along by it engrossed and curious to see what happened next. It's a very human story set in a complex place and time. The characters struggle to keep their faith and balance in the midst of it all. They succeed, fail, learn, and are forged.And the cat is very, very true: smart, self-possessed, jealously devoted to his ""masters,"" and on equal or better intellectual footing compared to the human characters.",positive

0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,Sfar's Best!,A delightfully funny story! A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat's-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. It's a love story.

""The Rabbi's Cat"" is like the best bits from ""Sandman"", Spiegeman's ""Maus"", Satrapi's ""Persepolis"" and Gilbert Hernandez ""Palomar""-stories mixed into one stunning story. Truly wonderful.

I highly recommend it.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,4.0,Great introduction to Jewish practices,"A widowed rabbi, his cat and his daughter live in Algeria spin a story and lesson in Judaism very cleverly crafted in this graphic novel. Through the cat, who having eaten the family parrot, is imparted a miraculous ability to speak, questions and challenges to the Jewish faith are presented to the rabbi and the rabbi's rabbi. First the cat lies about eating the parrot, and then he insists on learning the Kabbalah and wants a Bar Mitzvah.The rabbi's daughter gets married to a French rabbi and they honeymoon in Paris to meet with the in-laws. The widowed rabbi and the cat accompany them and the rabbi's faith is tested along the way, as well as his tolerance for those who don't practice the faith as he is believes it should be practiced.You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate this graphic novel. It's funny, sad and is a wonderful little theological study.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,A charming piece of work,"I didn't exactly like the look of the cat, though I have to admit a good resemblance to the artist's own pet.The story begins in Algeria. A rabbi's cat ate a parrot, and suddenly finds himself able to speak. To his master's consternation, the cat immediately begins to tell lies (""I didn't eat any parrot!"") The rabbi decides to educate him in the way of the Torah, and the cat insists he wants a Bar Mitzvah, and that by cat's age he is well past thirteen.The author cleverly works interesting questions about religion and culture into the story in a charming, humorous and witty way. There is a magic, a tenderness in the story telling. The cat looks a bit devilish in the beginning, but his unique view of things make for interesting narration. The rabbi character is so disarmingly endearing in his honesty, and his love for his cat and his daughter, it's impossible not to love him.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,Fabulous.,Joann Sfar is a true master. This is a magical piece of work - so alive and full of color and character! I'd give it ten stars if i could!!,positive

It is a fitting testimony to the fact that a graphic novel is not just a comic book on steroids. So when you read it, do not forget to study the pictures closely.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,Imaginitive & Insightful,"Beautiful book! Joann Sfar wonderfully illustrates some classic questions about human identity, Jewish identity, the human condition, and the Jewish human condition.

0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,"A wonderful, funny-sad book","The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,My Rabbi loved this book too,"This book is great fun to read. The cat is a wonderful character, particularly when he is arguing theology and Talmud. I suspect if cats really could talk and argue theology, they'd act much like the one drawn in this book. In fact the book was inspired by the author's real cat (who doesn't speak, at least that I know of :-)) but apparently does understand how to keep his humans.This book can be enjoyed on several levels - as a fable about a cat and his humans, as a series of theological and philosophical debates, or just as a fun story about a talking cat and his adventures with his master.An important story element about midway through that the cat never figures out, but my wife did - it is an exchange, not a loss. This will make more sense after you've finished the book.One does not have to be Jewish or a scholar to appreciate the story and humor, but we gave a copy to our Rabbi as a gift and he loved it too. A couple more gift copies are planned too. Is that a positive endorsement or what?Parents of small children be warned - you might want to edit out the use of one bad word and some discussions of sexual topics.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,"This is the most wonderful, charming Jewish book to come out in the last ten years.","What can I say? The cat is one of the most charming, insightful, and funny characters to appear since Philip Roth's more audacious characters. This book is both laugh-out-loud funny, sad, sardonic, and ultimately life-affirming. It is an extremely offbeat book - trying to describe it is almost impossible. You really have to see it to ""get"" it. Unfortunately, no preview pages appear on the site, because that would greatly help to convey the character of the book.To give you an idea: in the first section, the cat eats a parrot and gains the power of speech. He explores all of the things one can do with that: taunt, lie, blaspheme, and bait. The rabbi wants to teach him Torah, but he wants to learn Kabalah. The issue is brought to ""the rabbi's rabbi,"" where the cat informs him that:""I want to convert to Judaism. He asks me why.I tell him that if I am a good Jew, the rabbi will let me spend time with his daughter.I explain to him that the rabbi's daughter is my mistress.That I can't live without her, because she is my joy, and love is a beautiful thing.He tells me that my motives for converting to Judaism are unsatisfactory, that my love of God isn't sincere.I never said anything about love of God....He says that thinking of God fills even the grayest days with sunlight. He says that the love of God should be almost carnal. He tells me that it is an intellectual love but you should always feel as though you were cradled in the arms of a master who is invincible, benevolent, and just.I tell him that this is exactly what I feel for my mistress. ...I answer that he blasphemes, that my mistress is true.He says that only God is true.I say that God is a reassuring myth. I say that he doesn't have anyone to take care of him because he is old and his parents are dead.I say that I have my mistress and I will never be alone because I will die before she does. He throws my master and me out.""Couple dialog like this with the wonderful drawings, the cat's flashing green naughty eyes, the gentle rabbi and his beloved daughter, and you have an amazingly odd, touching, and engaging book.Be advised: this is not a children's book (although if you are liberal with your older children and don't mind them dealing with some adult themes, I'm sure a lot would love it). The themes are theology, faith, death, existential fear, love, religion versus secularity, jealousy, and even class differences in France. Don't be put off though; it's an easy, fun, and quick read. Sfar is immensely talented, and the sparse prose has been carefully thought out and apparently translates well. Don't miss this one!",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,4.0,Blessed are those who transgress,"This book works on many different levels. I feel that the main theme of this work is summed up in one panel, when the rabbi says, ""Blessed are thou, who allows us to transgress.""There is an underlying theme of bitterness in this book; the rabbi is widowed; the cat wants to become a bar-mitzvah, Paris has changed the rabbi's family, and the wonderful singer can only find work as a clown.The main story is that of a cat narrating the events in the lives of his owners, a rabbi and his daughter. When the cat eats a parrot, he gains the power of speech, only to lose it when he wants to break one of the ten commandments.There is a lot of religious details the author has provided, but for some reason he left out one rabbinic tradition, that of a wife cutting her hair when she marries.Another theme is the role ignorance of Kabbalah and Talmud play in religious circles.In summary, this book is a wonderful tale, but not meant for kids, due to some of the translated language.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,4.0,Like Issac Bashevis Singer - with pictures!,"I stumbled upon this book while browsing in the world of graphic novels, where I rarely venture. They usually give me headaches, but this one revealed a quirky style and a refreshing lack of onomatopoeia in starbursts. It's so much easier to tell a good story when you're not constantly being interrupted by POW!! and ZOK!!! and the like.As a cat owner, I confess that it was the title that grabbed my attention, but I'm guessing that the plurality of cat lovers will not like the way the cat is drawn: Sfar's style sometimes reminds me a bit of Ralph Steadman's, and the cat's proportions change according to his mood and the context of the scene. Sfar focuses on intriguing details--a character might be drawn very sketchily in one scene, but some small object in the background will be meticulously rendered. In the next scene, the same character will fill the frame and be drawn with equal attention. This style works out perfectly for as mutable a creature as a cat.Format and style aside, the story is what really made me buy this book. The prose works just as it should with the illustrations, an aspect that I think some graphic novelists overwork, or ignore. As a fan of Issac Bashevis Singer, I was sucked in when the rabbi's initial response to his talking cat was ""Will he be a Jew?"" And, more importantly, ""Will he be a good Jew?"" (Not being Jewish, by the way, has not been an obstacle to enjoying the work of either author.)The book is divided into three separate stories, and while the first was my favorite, I also enjoyed following the cat and his rabbi as their family circle expanded to include an exotic friend with a lion (who gets along amiably with the cat) and a down-on-his-luck singer who has been reduced to belting out bawdy numbers on Sabbat.Like the very popular ""Persepolis"", this book has shown that graphic novels can be both funny and deep, and that they deserve to share shelves with the best non-graphic novels of our time.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,A great read.,"I passed over The Rabbi's Cat repeatedly in the graphic novel section of my bookstore... the cover was a bit of a turn-off and the size is a bit cumbersome. I finally flipped through it at my library and checked it out. I'm beating myself up now for not reading this sooner! What makes this graphic novel really great is the way that Sfar is able to weave very subtle everyday elements of life into his stories. The characters' emotions, particularly the rabbi and the cat have such great range and believeablity... many Western comics artists should take note.Indeed, its a welcome break from the white-boy 'slice of life' comics that are so trendy in comics now. The Rabbi even has a debate with his cat over Western-vs.Eastern thought (albiet regarding religion and philosophy). Its a much needed return to rich storytelling in comics.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,4.0,Humorous and profound,"""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a sometimes humorous, sometimes profound graphic novel about an unworldly rabbi, his daughter Zlabya and her cat in early 20th century Algeria, as told by the cat. The cat gains the ability to speak by swallowing the family parrot, an act that he, of course, immediately denies. The conversations between the cat, the rabbi, and the ""rabbi's rabbi"" are some of the funniest parts of the book, but along with such questions as whether the cat should be considered Jewish or whether his age (for bar mitzvah purposes) should be calculated in human or ""cat"" years, is some serious and wide-ranging philosophical and theological discussion. What is a Jew? What does it mean to be created ""in God's image""? What is the difference between the cat's feeling for his mistress and the love of God? As a Reconstructionist I like the idea put forward by another reviewer of this being ""the first Reconstructionist cat."" And what other branch of Judaism would a cat choose?Eventually the cat pronounces the sacred name of God and loses his ability to speak, and from this point the book concentrates more on the relationships between human beings, although still from the cat's perspective. He experiences the pangs of jealousy when a young rabbi from an assimilated French family comes to their town and falls in love with his young mistress . He and his master then travel with the young couple to Paris to meet the groom's family, and must adjust to a very different kind of Jewish life before they return home to Algeria. On their journey they encounter several delightful minor characters, from the rabbi's cousin Malkah of the Lions (and his pet lion) to a cabaret singer in Paris.The Rabbi's Cat can be read on several different levels - as an entertaining ""talking animal"" story, an affectionate portrait of Sephardic Jewish culture, or a complicated story of human (and animal-human) relationships. Caution to parents: This book contains brief nudity and some mature language and themes.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,A Masterpiece! Meet the first reconstructionist cat and rabbi from Algeria,"Safr's beautifully illustrated tale of a traditional rabbi who loses his faith in the face of colonial assimilation and a secular cat who tells the tale is on the level of Will Eisner's Contract With God and Art Speigelman's Maus. American readers will certainly connect to the tale as an Algerian parallel to the intellectual journey of Mordecai Kaplan, the American Jewish thinker whose Judaism as a Civilization was penned at the same time of the setting of this fictional fable. Safr raises the ultimate post-Enlightenment question: What is the role of religion in the absence of a supernatual God who acts in history? He is the first writer, I believe, to have a street-smart house cat answer this question. Rabbi Daniel S. Brenner, Director, Center for Multifaith Education, Auburn Theological Seminary, NYC.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,good artwork too!,"The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,The Cat's Meow,"Bad pun, I know, but perfectly apt for this wonderful book. ""The Rabbi's Cat"" is a graphic novel set in Algeria in the mid 1930s. A poor rabbi lives with his lovely daughter Zlabya and their precocious gray cat. In over 850 marvelously-varied panels, author Joann Sfar tells the story of the trio as they deal with the cosmic questions of life, love, God's existence and fickle human nature. The story shuttles between sun-baked traditional North Africa and rain-drenched, cosmopolitan Paris. Sfar's palette ranges from the reds, oranges and yellows of the rabbi's home country to the muted blues, greens and whites of the Moroccan night and of the Parisian day.The book's characters are wonderful and complex. The old rabbi is kind, God-fearing and gentle, but fears being replaced by a more urban man who speaks French. His beautiful, young daughter, content to remain in her father's house, playing the piano and reading, also longs for love. The cat -- a cunning and shameless atheistic and opportunist -- gains speech, insists on being Bar Mitzvah and demands to learn the Kabala. He contends pointedly, if ignorantly, with the learned over theological questions -- all the while angling for a night on the prowl. There's also old and sinewy Malka of the Lions, striding manfully from the desert, toting an ancient rifle and accompanied by his faithful leonine companion. The book follows the characters through normal life events -- shopping, praying for the dead, washing dishes -- but touches on themes of death, hypocrisy, apostasy and man's relationship with a rather enigmatic and silent God. Using this humble cast, and in a medium not fully taken seriously by all, Sfar plumbs depths not normally plumbed by many serious works. Sfar's art is deceptively spare, but is always evocative and never dull. His message is one of optimism, delivered with humor and humanity.If this book were a film, I would rate it PG-13 for a small amount of nudity and vulgarity, and for the adult themes it explores.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,A fantastic graphic novel,I read the book cover to cover because I could not put it down. Some parts are definitely not for children but for adults who will see how layered the story and characters truly are.,positive

This is a charming, thought provoking little book that can be read at many different levels. No wonder my rabbi was the one who suggested that we read this. If you understand the basics of Judiasm, you'll get more out of this book. But even if you are not, you will be charmed by this fanciful tale.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,"Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat's eyes","""The Rabbi's Cat,"" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,5.0,Beautiful and Entertaining,"The artwork here was fantastic and original.

Suffice it to say, Sfar's work is consistently enjoyable, often provocative, and always entertaining. It may not be everybody's fruit (there is nudity, profanity, challenging topics... like life itself), but this is certainly among the best in graphic story-telling. Read and enjoy!",positive
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,3.0,Too Aimless for My Taste,"I've long been a fan of the graphic novel, and I picked this one up mainly on the strength of its Algerian setting. Parents should take note: despite its somewhat children's bookish cover and title, this book is definitely intended for an older audience (there are some four-letter words and nudity), and the somewhat rambling narrative may well not hold the attention of teens.The story starts in colonial Algiers sometime in the 1930s, where we meet a humble widowed Algerian rabbi, his beautiful daughter, and their scrawny cat. The first third of the book concerns itself mainly with the rabbi and the cat, who, after eating a parrot, gains the ability to speak. Before long, the cat wants to learn about Judaism and convert, and starts asking all kinds of thorny theological questions. This leads to a pretty funny debate with the rabbi's mentor -- all of does a nice job of capturing the disputative nature of Judaism. (Those with a background in Judaism may well get a lot more richness and texture from this storyline than non-Jews like me.)This promising storyline is abandoned when the cat loses its power of speech, and the middle section segues into a somewhat meandering account of the rabbi's need to pass a French test in order to remain rabbi and a visit by the rabbi's dashing rural cousin. While this does a reasonable job of depicting the indignities of colonialism, there's not much else to this section. The arrival of a thoroughly urbane young rabbi from Paris propels the final third, as the beautiful daughter falls in love with, and marries him. The married couple and Algerian rabbi then visit the husband's family in Paris (with the cat tagging along). There, the rabbi has trouble coping with the cultural differences, and goes on a little adventure to track down a musician nephew, leading to even further indignities.I can't say I found the book nearly as delightful as most others seem to. Despite the running theme of faith, the narrative is altogether too disjointed to my taste, and despite bursts of jollity, the entire tone seemed rather wistful. The artwork is similarly impressionistic, with forms ranging from realistic to exaggerated to surreal. The palate is quite nice, as the natural earth tones of Algeria contrast vividly with the oppressive dreary grays and blacks of Paris. At times the panels get a little crowded by text though, and the entire book is a bit 'wordier"" than your average graphic novel",neutral
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,1.0,Unpleasant and disappointing,"This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and ""show"" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!",negative
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,3.0,Grafic Novels,Our book club tried the Rabbi's Cat to see what all the press concerning new grafic novels.

0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,1.0,Self-Serving Message,"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.",negative
0375422811,The Rabbi's Cat,1.0,Not what it looks like on the cover.,"As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either.

0882899228,JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness,4.0,Jean Hill's Eye-Witness Story,"Jean Hill saw President Kennedy shot and she believed that at least one of the shooters was on the grassy knoll behind the fence and she estimated that between 4 and 6 shots were fired. Her story was heavily disputed by first the Secret Service who kept her in custody for hours on that fateful day, the CIA agent who was present in her first meeting with the FBI, and the FBI who interviewed her extensively for days after the assassination, as well as the Warren Commission's attorney who humiliated and intimidated her before taking her testimony for the Warren Commission.Some of the most interesting facts presented in this book are:1. Jean Hill saw Jack Ruby run at break-neck speed from the Texas Book Depository to the fence on the grassy knoll immediately after the shooting of JFK, as she ran towards the fence where she thought the shooter was.2. She saw a man in a Dallas-police uniform holding a rifle and standing behind the fence on the grassy knoll, immediately after the shooting, right before she was grabbed and escorted away by two Secret Service men.3. Her boyfriend was J.B. Marshall, the Dallas police officer who was on a motorcycle to the left rear of the president's car and who's helmet and bike got splattered with JFK's blood and brains. He told her that LBJ's Secret Service people instructed the motorcycle cops at the Dallas airport that these changes were being made: (a) the parade route was being changed to cut through Dealey Plaza on Elm Street; (b) the motorcycle cops would not be at the front of the presidential limousine as they normally would have been, but would only be at the rear of the presidential limousine; (c) the order of the cars in the motorcade was changed so that Johnson's car would not be immediately behind the presidential car, but that a carload of Secret Service would be in between the President's car and LBJ's car. Most shocking of all, was his report to Jean Hill that another motorcycle cop witnessed that LBJ started ducking down in his car at least 30 to 40 seconds before the first shots were fired.4. Arlen Specter, who questioned her in Dallas for the Warren Commission, was the one who proposed the &quot;single bullet theory&quot; that was adopted by the Warren Commission. His butchered transcript of her testimony to the Warren Commission was &quot;heavily edited, completely distorted and shamelessly fabricated.&quot;Author Bill Sloan does a credible job of telling Jean Hill's story and explaining her inner turmoil and emotional trauma about being a witness to the assassination. He explains about:1. Why she refused to go to Washington to testify before the Warren Commission.2. That she was romantically involved with a married man at the time (J.B. Marshall) and how he repeatedly tried to convince her to keep quiet about what she knew, and how he evidently knew more than he wanted to tell her.3. That the FBI kept her home under surveillance for 15 months after the assassination.4. Why she would not testify in the trial of Clay Shaw in New Orleans, although J.B. Marshall and Mary Moorman did.5. Her eventual vindication and validation through experiences with Bill Marrs (author of Crossfire) who introduced her to others who witnessed the assassination, and her experiences with Oliver Stone and Kevin Cossner during the filming of the movie &quot;JFK.&quot;6. The details of the attempts on her life (most significantly, one almost-fatal car wreck caused by the steering-wheel bolts being unscrewed and another time when her car's brake-fluid line was found to be cut).The most inexplicable fact about Jean Hill's story is why was Jack Ruby running at break-neck speed towards the shooter behind the fence on the grassy knoll? She did not know who Jack Ruby was until she saw him on tv, as he shot Oswald. Her fear that no one would believe her about seeing Ruby running towards one of the shooters was increased when she was told by FBI agent Shanklin that eye witnesses had proved that Ruby was not at Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Perhaps her identification of Ruby at Dealey Plaza is the clue to why her testimony was distorted by the Warren Commission, why she was intimidated and humiliated, and why her story is so important.

I am not an aspiring actress, and have only delt with Two Literary Agents in the sale of my first 4 books; however, I found Ms. Rainfords book an excellent resource. I would recomend this book to anyone who has an Agent; is thinking of getting an Agent; wants to become an Agent; or is thinking of leaving her Agent. Or anyone who is going to HOLLYWOOD to PITCH anything.It's hard to believe Nancy Rainford hasn't written more books. Perhaps a humorous novel about her business?

Here is a book written by the ultimate insider (one who has seen Hollywood from many angles, has worked with the people you only see on the silver screen, and obviously has the gift of gab she writes about).

It is that valuable and should be required reading for every actor in Hollywood.The book is not just a primer on the Hollywood protocol and pecking order, but &quot;How to Agent Your Agent&quot; goes into such wonderful detail so as to demystify how an actor should handle his/her agent. So many actors are constantly in a quandry of how to handle a situation with their agents, or they are downright dissatisfied with their agents.

Years of experience are in this book to help keep actors from making mistakes when it comes representation.Thank you, Ms. Rainford, for telling it like it is (and being such a great storyteller).",positive

The author takes you through the experience of agenting your agent and step by step shows you how in a realistic, intelligent fashion. When you are finished you will know how (and if) an agent thinks, works and functions AND if it is in your behalf. ALSO, if you want DISH, it's better than a gossip column. I stayed up all night considering whether I should take this gal's advice and plunge back into the search for success in film. Try it, you'll like it. If you are a working actor, you will definitely get MORE work, and if you are new at the game, you might very well come out a winner! Most importantly, it is tongue in cheek and funny.

I think this has a lot to do with it being written mainly from an actor's agent perspective. And while the author throws in tidbits about how this is supposed to relate to the lit world, there just isn't enough depth. Nor does it seem is it written for someone at the beginning of their lit career where what you can expect from an agent is simply different (based on my experience and that of my friends in similar stages of their careers).

B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,4.0,The Seasons of Our Lives.,"The time span for a leaf is approximately six months. Autumn is the time of year with the trees dressed in their finest array of colors (though I love the Spring pastel colors) -- gold, green, orange, yellow and red. You can consider the spectacular colors represent the people of the world. We all come from the same root of humanity, the tree of life. This the time to prepare for an inward journey and give time to personal reflection. The dance of the beautiful falling leaves teaches us the lesson of uplifting the spirit, as the leaves fall, our own regrets and sadness can fall away from our inner trees.Do the leaves know how it feels to bid farewell to the warmth of the sun? As they fall, they mingle with the earth to nourish the trees in the woods. Their lives have a purpose, just as our lives do. George Cooper wrote: ""Come, little leaves, said the wind one day, come over the meadows with me and play, put on your dresses of red and gold; summer is gone, and the days grow cold."" It is finally beginning to look and feel like autumn. And with it comes cooler temperatures and lower humidity which make the nights clear and sharp. November is a great time to study planets in the spectacular night skies. Mars is closer than we've ever experienced it. Mercury and Venus are set for a rare alignment. The ringed-world Saturn rises just before midnight. It's a great time to stargaze. Meteors, sometimes called 'shooting stars,' are Taurids amd Leonids using fireballs, bright meteors which look like flares in the night sky, will put on a great show this year. The meteor showers are a sight to see, especially for the astronomer and his students. Orion will be visible, looking like an hourglass, some time after Mars which starts its show at sunset.

B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,5.0,"A beautiful, metaphorical explanation of death. Perfect for a grieving child or adult!","I don't often write reviews, but this is a book that has had a profound effect on my life.At 8 years old my Father suddenly passed away. My Mother (who had been separated from my Dad for 6 years) did her best to get me help for my overwhelming grief, but she wasn't exactly a very hands-on Mom and my sudden need overwhelmed her as well. I felt very alone and lost. At that age we are not usually equipped with the ability to understand death, and especially when it is sudden, we are not prepared for the questions and feelings death brings. My behavior was that of a depressed, confused child. I developed extreme OCD and frantically cleaned my room, our house, and other's if they'd let me. I became a loner at school and carried my Dad's ashes everywhere with me in my backpack. Fortunately a couple special people came into my life and helped me cope. My Mom had a friend who was very spiritual, not in a religious way, just a strong faith in the good in life, and death. She introduced me to the idea of angels and the divine. Some of it may have seemed corny to me now as an adult, but it was something I desperately needed. The idea that maybe my Dad was now my guardian angel, that he wasn't totally gone from my life after all, was a belief that brought me immense comfort. Of course I don't know whether that could have been true or not, but my adult skepticism had not developed yet. All that matters is that it helped me cope easier. My Mom made the wise choice to take me to a therapist for help and I'm so glad she did. This therapist taught me about what grief is and how to move through it gracefully. I learned the valuable skill of expressing my feelings and facing what is so difficult, but so necessary. I wrote poetry about my Dad and reflected on my memories of him. I began to recover and heal. I still believe at 24 years old that I grew up then; that my Father's death was kind of the end of my true childhood. But I learned how to cope, not just with death, but with hardship and other losses as well. Some people never have the help and opportunity to develop this valuable life skill. I'm fortunate because my short life thus far has been full of hardship and loss. Too much.How does all this relate to this book? That therapist I had knew that the new idea of death was too much for a child, so she showed me this book from her shelf, ""The Fall of Freddie the Leaf"", and it helped me understand the life cycle and why our lives end. It was exactly what I needed; I began to understand. This story is INVALUABLE to ANYONE who is facing the death of a loved one. It is basic enough for a young child to understand, and heartfelt enough to mean the world to a grieving adult. I keep a copy on my bookshelf to remind me that there is always hope.Buy this book and you'll never forget it.",positive

With our passing the tree/family has become stronger with what we have left behind in values, morals and how we loved one another while on this earth. To think or believe we have had no effect on another human being whether a family, friend,etc. would have said I never lived.

At the time professor Buscaglia was sweeping public television with appearances speaking about love and the value of a simple hug. My wife and I were fortunate enough to get seats to a public lecture by Dr. Buscaglia at Harvard University. He captivated the audience, and at the end of his lecture we joined a long line to get our hug from Leo, who was a big bear of a man, but man or woman, you got a hug. It was a very touching moment with many tearful eyes - yet such a simple thing, a hug.Over the years, with the death of parents and loved ones, I put ""Freddie the Leaf"" in the hands of all our children and many others. Most recently our beloved Airedale Tracy was taken from us by a rare immunological disease after she struggled two months for life - much like Freddie the leaf.

B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,5.0,It Is Possible To Talk With Children About Death,"The Fall of Freddie the Leaf, written by Dr. Leo Buscaglia is a non-threatening story that explains that everything that lives is part of a natural cycle. This simplistically written 15 page story, accompanied by richly colored photographs, provides understanding by readers of all ages. Most appropriate for students in grades K-3, this story gracefully puts into perspective the naturally balanced relationship between life and death.The story, The Fall of Freddie the Leaf, uses the mentoring approach of an older leaf named Daniel who shows a younger leaf named Freddie that the changes experienced through life are what life is about. As Freddie the Leaf and his companion leaves experience their own changes along with the passing seasons, Freddie learns that death is part of life. This understanding that Freddie develops prepares him for his own calm and peaceful experience as he falls from his branch with the winter's snow.As a whole, our culture has great difficulty dealing with the issue of death. By using nature's natural change of the seasons as a metaphor, children are inspired to listen to, and read, this story's message. Without compromising personal cultural beliefs or practices, children are exposed to the love and power all humans encompass in being united in the understanding that the ""end"" is also the ""beginning.""An important part of the story, The Fall of Freddie the Leaf, is that Freddie was made to feel safe by the clear answers provided for him by the older leaf, Daniel. Children need to feel their questions will be validated and listened to with serious consideration and honest response. This is what gives children a sense of security in the constantly changing world around them.Grief is a natural process in response to a traumatic event, such as with a death or loss, and one that is experienced uniquely from person to person. The natural process of grief has many forms and can take as long as two years or more to complete. What helps a child move through this process is to provide them with the opportunity to ask questions, provide answers relating directly to what is asked, and to provide positive means for the outlet of their emotions. Most importantly, children need to be assured that they are safe and that their emotions are supported.For students in grades K-3, the facilitation of a large group activity giving students the opportunity to share an experience they might have had with death or another significant loss, is a healthy invitation for students to begin a long awaited healing process. It also gives students with fear or uneasy feelings related to death or loss, the opportunity to ask questions without the fear of being outcaste by their peers. A list of emotions shared by the members of the group can be recorded, identifying the spectrum of emotions experienced.Independently, students can be invited to decorate a large leaf cut-out with a picture of a place they feel safe. This place can be in a favorite chair, a specific room, somewhere outside, or even with a special person. On the backside of the leaf, students are then asked to write or dictate any questions or feelings they might have about death or loss, or messages for a special person or pet that has died or who may be very ill.Once the drawing process has been completed, students can be asked to regroup and share what they drew, and also share any messages or questions they recorded on their leaf. This process should be voluntary. A child should never be forced to speak if not wanting to. The mere act of listening to others share experiences that might be similar can be very healing in itself.The discussion of death and grief is a natural process and one that is important to understand before bringing it into the classroom. Especially with children, grief is displayed in many different ways, and a teacher or group facilitator needs to be aware of this. As Joyce D. Davidson and Kenneth J. Doka state in their publication titled, Living With Grief, children very often display ""short feeling spans"" showing that they only can sustain strong emotions for short periods of time. What is most helpful for children in a time of grief is to provide them with time to listen to their expression of what they are feeling, and to allow them time to explore their many reactions to a loss. Sharing stories and memories can assist children to understand that the life and the death process is not isolated to just their experience. By offering tangible support children become more aware of their connection with other individuals and are able to find strength and support from those around them.",positive
B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,5.0,"I love the ""message without the sermon"" flavor.....","We all will die, but not all of us are willing to believe in the concocted ""life after death"" experiences that every religion in every society has developed to help us cope with our reluctance to accept death and its finality. This book is great for teaching children about life, purpose, and death without smothering the lesson with religious jargon and terrifying messages of a one-shot deal to avoid the fiery pit of hell... This is a worthy read for anyone.",positive
B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,5.0,More Than Grief Counseling,"Many people first encounter ""Freddie"" during the times surrounding the deaths of loved ones, but the value of the book goes far beyond grief counseling.The story of Freddie the Leaf is ultimately not just about death, but about becoming attuned to the cycles of life. As such, it should be bought and read to children regardless of whether a loved one is dying. A large part of the story is concerned with how Freddie lives and relates to the world around him: the other leaves on his tree, the tree itself and to the world surrounding the tree, the people and creatures inhabiting that world and so on.This is a book about how we relate to the Universe, how we find a place in it that is right for us, and how we see ourselves as part of its inevitable movement. Death is only a part of that movement.The grief caused by death is, after all, not about the death itself, but rather about the absence of the loved one. The understanding of death does not lessen the pain of that absence, but it does place it in a context that is larger than any specific death.Freddie's reluctance to let go and fall, is really about his failure to relax into his place in the larger context. Once he sees himself as a part of the Universe, he finds peace and contentment in it. As such, ""The Fall of Freddie the Leaf"" is an extraordinarily effective way of introducing, not only discussions about death, but discussions with children (and adults, I might add) about the rhythms of life, and how making a good death is largely dependent on living a good and authentic life, as Freddie did.The book is, after all, sub-titled, ""A Story of Life for All Ages,"" and as such, it deserves to be on everyone's bookshelf whether they are dealing with a death in the family or not.",positive

Great for adults, sure, even possibly OK for adults to borrow verbiage from to discuss death with children. Completely inappropriate to give to children to explore on their own.I had nightmares for years, fixated on my ultimate demise rather than a healthy grieving process.Here's a thought-- talk to the children instead of passing them a book.

Thank goodness my little girl didn't pay attention because I don't want to deal with her freaking out at the approach of winter, which is the conclusion of the book.

However, the book speaks to me as much about individual purpose and the value of life filled with meaning through service to others. I think the work is deceptively simple and when children read it (or when it is read to them) they see Freddie's vulnerability and can relate. However, adults see a much deeper meaning, how we connect to others in life and that the cycle continues unabated.In fact, I would argue that this is one of the best books on management and human relations written in my lifetime. It places in perspective all the things we may think but often do not say about the meaning of work and how we touch others.This is a timeless book and one that should be read at various stages and times of life.

Finally, Daniel explains death and letting go.The book uses the gentle, concrete metaphor of the annual changes in leaves on a tree to help anyone appreciate the different phases of life. Each leaf leaves the tree differently: some drift down quietly, and others fiercely resist the tug of the wind. This shows how each person approaches death differently. Freddy resists until he is withered and brown, the last leaf on the branch. Finally he lets go and experiences a sense of peace.Although the leaves, die each year, they are part of the tree which lives on, although even it has a finite life. the book discusses the interconnecedness of life and death. however, it does not take a stand on the specifics of a life after death.This would help children of a wide range of ages appreciate not only death, but also the different phases of life. Each time Freddy the leaf changes with the seasons, it is puzzling but he learns its value. He sees how the tree and the leaves have purpose. this helps one see that life has purposes that may not be immediately obvious. This book is also moving for adults who may be experiencing a life transition. I recommend that anyone, of any age take this book and read it under a tree.",positive

B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,5.0,Great resource,"I used this book with a boy a worked with a few years ago. He was 9 at the time, and a close relative had died. Before a colleague showed me the book, I struggled to find the right words to comfort him with, to no avail. The experience was a first hand confrontation with the fact that our culture generally has a great deal of difficulty dealing with the issue of death. Of all the books I've read that attempt to help us deal with this problem, this one is the best.This simply, poignant story about the changing of the seasons gave me a bridge to talk to the child and helped him make sense of his loss. The language is simple enough for even a young child to understand. The pictures are gorgeous. It helped him cope with and understand his loss. As well, he was inspired to read the story to his classmates (this is a boy who previously hated reading) and it created a ""teachable moment"" for the whole group.This book is one that I would reccommend to anyone who is in contact with children. It would be an excellent addition to your personal library because it makes talking about a difficult, painful subject a great deal easier.",positive

As a family therapist, I have assisted children with grief on many times. I always strongly recommend this book. In American culture, we have been taught to think of death as unnatural. This is due to many reasons. A few are the youth obsessed media and advancements in science that have dramatically extended life expentancies. Other nations view death as a natural process. It is embraced as a season of life; therefore it is feared less. Freddie helps put death back into a natural perspective. The book has a spiritual, but non-demoninational tone. This is a must have for any home, not just for someone who is grieving. It truly is poetry.",positive

B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,5.0,A Small Book With A Big Message,"I was introduced to The Fall of Freddie the Leaf at the funeral of my dear friend's father in 2009. The priest who was handling the funeral brought the book out and began reading it. Initially, I thought to myself that this was a very unusual way to conduct a funeral, but as he continued to read the book to all of us, I found myself drawn into this very warm, tender and thought-provoking story. It was the perfect way to explain the life and death process to both children and adults present at the funeral. At the end of the story, the priest handed the book to the family to keep as a small memento of the occasion. I can say without a doubt that there was not one dry eye in the church.This book is definitely a classic that gently shows the delicate balance between life and death. As Freddie experiences the changing seasons along with the other leaves, he learns that death is part of life. I believe children and adults will be deeply touched by this story written by Dr. Leo Buscaglia. It is beautifully written, easy for children to understand and helpful in opening up discussions about death. It has since become one of my favorite books dealing with the subject of death, and I, too, by following the example of our beloved priest, provide this book to friends and their children who have experienced the grief of losing a loved one.",positive

B000HOMU4S,The Fall of Freddie the Leaf: 20th Aniversary Edition,4.0,A classic book on death and loss for children of all ages,"The Fall of Freddie the Leaf has become a classic in children's literature addressing the areas of death and loss. It beautifully illustrates the seasons of change and cycles of life that make up our very existence.Freddie is a leaf who shares a large branch with many of his friends in a large, towering tree in a public park. His best friend, Daniel seems to have more wisdom than the other leaves. When Freddie questions his purpose, the turn of the seasons, and the end of his life, Daniel has answers.Spring turns to summer, and summer gives way to fall. Winter approaches, and talk turns to death and the fear of the unknown.Where will we go when we die?"" (Freddie asks.)""No one knows for sure. That's the great mystery!"" (Daniel answers.)""Will we return in the spring?"" (Freddie asks.)""We may not, but Life will."" (Daniel answers.)On a Christian level, this particular passage left me with a longing for ""more,"" for a mention of the absolute hope that exists for each of us as we approach the end of life. Nevertheless, the ambiguity of that all-important unanswered question: ""Where will we go when we die?"" makes this book both an unbiased and non-threatening read for most faiths and spiritual persuasions.The Fall of Freddie the Leaf is a beautifully crafted story, masterfully told and presented. It artfully balances the cycles of life and death in a way that makes sense to children of all ages. Most families will find this book a useful part of their home library.",positive

Both her parents immigrated to the United States from Sweden. Her mother was a wonderful cook and this is a collection of her mother's recipes. She grew up with Cardamom Coffee Bread and has fond memories of her mother making cookies. Through the years she collected quite a selection of good recipes and added her own touches here and there. Some recipes are from friends and family.The recipes you will find are in 15 chapters. Appetizers & Beverages, Yeast Breads, Quick Breads, Breakfast & Brunch, Cakes & Frostings, Cookies, Desserts & Pies, Meat, Chicken, Fish, Pasta, Salads & Dressings, Soups and Vegetables. There is also a chapter on Miscellaneous and Equivalents & Substitutions.There are no color pictures, but a few cute sketches here and there. You will find a recipe for Swedish Fruit Bread, Swedish Yeast Twists, Swedish Pancakes, Swedish Cardamom Apple Cake, etc. All interspersed with other favorites.My grandmother made notes in this cookbook where she would change a recipe here or there. It looks like she used the recipe for Butter Cream Frosting and there might be a small typo in that recipe because she crossed out 1/2 cup milk and wrote in 1 to 2 tablespoons, which makes a lot more sense. I also have a feeling that some of my late grandmother's cooking secrets are hiding in the pages of this cookbook. Page 99 with a recipe for Chocolate-Banana-Cream Pie is a bit worn out. She also wrote in to add 1/4 teaspoon salt. I will sometimes use salted butter when using a recipe for a chocolate item as it is true, a bit of salt helps bring out the flavor of chocolate.~The Rebecca Review",positive

Beguines led a religious life that was flexible with one foot in both worlds. The mystics that arose out of the movement were unparalleled (Hadewijch of the Brabant, Mechtild of Magdeburg, Beatriz of Nazareth et al.). Their lives still speak volumes in the beguinages (cities of peace) that are kept alive throughout Belgium and Amsterdam. Their main contributions to the Catholic church were devotion to the Sacred Heart, devotion to the Eucharist and frequent recpetion via institution of the feast of Corpus Christi, the pieta which was a statue originating among the beautiful Flemish artwork found in their awesomely beautiful (church) chapels. The women worked for the poor and lived simple lives (w/o the vow of poverty) and were free to leave at any time. In their spirituality they developed negative theology (finding God where he is ""not""), emphasis on the divine origin of the soul and other gnostic aspects that do not cross the fine line from an interactive God into a manipulated God. Marguerite Porete excepted. The vernacular books they wrote were influential among more famous male mystics (Eckhart & Ruysbeck) & are as relevant today as they were then.

So my first disappointment after receiving ""Reggae routes"" (a gift from a well-meaning friend) was to discover how short it is. Although the authors seem to think that they've written a ""reggae bible"", in reality it barely qualifies as a primer, and not a very good one at that.The book is divided into 3 sections, so it makes sense to consider each one in turn.Section 1 briefly outlines the history of Jamaican music and on the whole is a pretty good introduction to the subject, but it's nothing like the definitive account I was expecting. The only really bad chapter is ""Reggae international"", which mainly consists of well-worn cliches about Bob Marley and actually says very little about the impact reggae has made beyond the shores of Jamaica, particularly in the UK since the 1960s, or about the huge influence of Jamaican music on today's rave and dj culture, or its specific contributions to the development of hip hop as well as more recent phenomena like drum 'n' bass.In Section 2 the authors list and discuss memorable recordings from the 1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s in roughly chronological order, and although most of their choices are worthy of inclusion, it's a far from comprehensive selection, mainly because they focus entirely on singles. It's true that reggae is without doubt a singles-driven genre, but failure to include some of the great albums from the last four decades means that many of Jamaica's finest recordings aren't even mentioned in ""Reggae routes"". What's worse is that some really significant singles are also missing, for example Wayne Smith's seminal King Jammy produced ""Under mi sleng teng"" (which kicked off the digital era in the mid-1980s) isn't included in the authors' 80s selection.It also rapidly becomes clear that they don't have anything original to say about the music, and their comments about individual records are often brief, insipid or clearly borrowed from other sources. This part of the book is also littered with mistakes, and mainly demonstrates the complete opposite of what Chang & Chen would like you to believe, ie the mere fact that you're from Jamaica does not make you an expert on reggae music (I was born in England, but that doesn't make me an expert on cricket)....They are clearly unfamiliar with some of the records they review. For example their brief description of U-Roy's ""Natty rebel"" correctly states that it's based on a recording of the Bob Marley song ""Soul rebel"", but they don't seem to realise that the recording in question is a cover version by the Gladiators (from their excellent ""Trenchtown mix-up"" album) and not by Bob Marley himself. Quite a few of the singles have also been assigned to the wrong year, which might be understandable for some of the more obscure tracks, but it's hard to believe that they don't know when massive hits like Marley's ""Three little birds"" came out....Section 3 mainly consists of lists: Jamaican radio charts for each year from 1960 to 1997, a ""most popular artists"" chart (based on the radio charts), the authors' top 100 reggae chart (featuring their favourite tracks from 1960 - 1980) and top 30 dancehall chart (featuring tracks from 1983 - 1996). It's a pity that the latter two charts consist solely of the two lists of records with no explanatory comments, because it would be interesting to know why the authors decided that these 130 tracks are better than the huge number of others which weren't included. Failing this, it would have been helpful to cross-reference each item in the chart with the page on which it is discussed in Section 2 of the book (although quite a few of them don't actually appear in Section 2). It's also a shame that the authors didn't compile an album chart, which readers would probably find more useful, and I'm mystified as to why they don't seem to think that anything worthwhile happened in 1981 and 1982! The book finishes with a list of sources and references and a very short essay about Rastafarianism, which for some reason is tagged on rather untidily at the end.Throughout the book the very variable quality of the photos and artwork is another let-down. Many of the images are either not well integrated with the text or poorly reproduced. For example, check out the pic of Lady Saw on p213 - although I'm quite prepared to believe it's really her, the photo is so blurred that it could just as easily be Nancy Reagan or even an alien from another planet! In addition, the choice of images to accompany individual sections of text is sometimes rather strange. For example, the authors illustrate their review of Black Uhuru's ""Solidarity"" with a picture of the front cover of the group's ""Sinsemilla"" album, which came out four years earlier and doesn't contain the track in question (it's actually from an album called ""Anthem""). And there are other examples which are just as bad....Overall, ""Reggae routes"" is the worst book on the subject that I've read, and as there are several infinitely superior reggae guides on the market, I'd strongly recommend that you avoid it.",negative
1566396298,Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music,5.0,THE DEFINTIVE BOOK ON REGGAE,"After reading Reggae Rasta Revolution and The Rough Guide To Reggae, I was very hesitant to buy this book. I was afraid it would be prove to be another waste of money. But thank God I ponied up the dough. Reggae Routes is not only indisputably the best book ever written on reggae (And I have read them all or at least all I could find!), it is simply an excellent book period and a must read for anyone interested in reggae, Jamaica, world music or popular music. It is beautifully written in a manner that defies you to put it down and is as comprehensive as it is possible to be. (I always wondered where Nyabinghi came from.) The pictures are wonderful and it is a very well designed book. I agree with 90% of the top 100. Nice to see it was all done in Jamaica by Jamaicans, just like the best reggae. I would wholeheartedly advise anyone reading this to immediately click on 'ADD TO SHOPPING CART' and order as many copies as you have friends who like reggae.",positive
1566396298,Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music,5.0,THE BEST REGGAE BOOK EVER?,"'Reggae Routes' claims to be the first book on reggae written by Jamaicans and covers every conceivable aspect of Jamaican music. The authors have an authentic feel for reggae and Jamaica and write quite stylishly. The photos and illustrations are excellent, the criticism is thought provoking and it's well researched - this is the only reggae book with footnotes I've ever seen and it's spiced with high spirited quotes from living legends past and present. I don't always agree with Chang and Chen's judgments, but on the whole their taste is pretty good and I can't seriously quarrel with their all-time reggae top 100 and dancehall top 30 lists. All in all it's a fascinating look at Jamaica through its music and is a must read for anyone interested in the country or its culture. I particularly enjoyed the asides on Jamaican women and men. 'Reggae Routes' is the best book on reggae or Jamaica I've seen and probably one of the best I've read on popular music.",positive
1566396298,Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music,5.0,Reggae Routes - About so much more than music.,"MUCH MORE THAN MUSICTwo Jamaican Reggae enthusiasts pen the history of reggae music from the Jamaican perspective - and end up giving us so much more.REGGAE ROUTES - By Kevin O'Brien Chang and Wayne Chen&quot;Jamaica has less than one-twentieth of one percent of the world's population and produces even less of its wealth...In terms of popular music, though, it's the most fortunate nation on earth. Like everything else, reggae has had to adapt to a faster moving world. But it remains inarguably Jamaican, a rhythm in tune with its people, not only listened to all over the globe but still listening to itself.&quot; Such is the tone for Reggae Routes. From cover to cover, and with practically flawless consistency, lead author Kevin O'Brien Chang and co-author Wayne Chen bring to life the story of Jamaica's reggae music with the same frankness, pride and gutsy insight that punctuate this excerpt.When asked what prompted him to write about reggae, Brien Chang just laughs. &quot;Oh, I don't know! My friends and I used to spend a lot of time as youngsters talking and arguing about reggae and its evolution over the years. It was like a hobby of sorts.&quot; An understatement indeed! As the name implies, Reggae Routes walks the reader through the entire history of Jamaica's hallbrand of music, now globally famous, if not unmistakablly recognised. The work is no less than thorough in its research, one of its obvious strengths, with every musical contributor being given his or her fair share of the limelight. Fear not. Bob Marley, while featured prominently on the book's cover, does not upstage his colleagues.In fact, the book is a virtual three-dimensional expose of reggae's history, with all aspects covered, or rather, uncovered. We are made privy to the many impromptu meetings, the social observations and the private battles that lay the path for the creation and promotion of the songs that we would eventually come to know and love, and which would eventually lead to the birth of entire musical trends. Humorous anecdotes about the naming of songs and the origins of names (even reggae itself) only begin to whet the appetite for information. From the origin of Kumina to the influence of Louise Bennett, the book's occasional scholastic touch is neatly balanced with its obviously entertaining flair. The careful but lively detail used in this account is a tribute and a compliment to Jamaicans and reggae fans alike who may already know some of the history. As if sharing the mircrophone in their own recording studio, the authors prudently and frequently share the voice of authority with every side involved in an issue. From song writers to producers, musicians to singers, the opinions positive and negative, contradictory and favourable are all included in the mix, and lend much credibility to the book. Readers will appreciate this approach by these two businessmen-turned-authors who use fact to support their views, rather than force an opinion with blind passion.But if research and supportive facts are the canvas of this piece, then it is the fresh presentation and perspective employed that make Reggae Routes a masterpiece, and much more than an account of Jamaica's musical history. The book in efect also tells the story of social Jamaica in its post independence years, and makes the link between the nationalistic pride we searached for then and the role reggae played in helping us find it. The authors also include enough global perspective to remind us of how influenced and influential our island nation has been over the years. For the younger generation especially, many of these points will make for an eye-opener. In fact, &quot;eye-opening&quot; describes much of this book. It is virtually crammed with information for the taking. Written in any other way, it would have taken on a more didactic tone. But herein lies its other strength. It has been expertly crafted by two individuals who have managed to weave into the written word the same upbeat lilt natural to the book's subject. There is no disappointment here. Chang and Chen are gifted storytellers. They have written their book with the hearts and &quot;nuffness&quot; of two Jamaicans whose passion for reggae music could not be contained. They had said they were determined to write a book on reggae from the Jamaican perspective, but one which both Jamaicans and foreigners could appreciate and share. In the end, they accomplished their goal.",positive

1566396298,Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican Music,5.0,A Wonderfully Entertaining And Informative Read For Reggae Lovers,"Reggae Routes is by far the best written and most entertaining book on reggae. Unlike so many others that get bogged down on irrelevant details it cuts to the chase and tells you everything a curious and intelligent person could want to know about Jamaican Music. If you want to know about obscure albums released only in the UK - or happen to be a Scratch Perry or Flipper Price? fanatic - then you probably will find it inadequate. But if you want a good read that tells you what really happened on the Jamaican musical scene - and Reggae Routes is great at historical perspective and context - buy this book.Unlike others who just make it up, the authors actually got historical charts to show what was popular in Jamaica when. And the authors' choice top 100 reggae and top 30 dancehall lists are a great guide to starting your own reggae collection. I don't agree all the way through but they clearly know their reggae. Only caveat is that the dancehall lists stops in 1998 so no 'Gimme The light' or 'Welcome to Jamrock'",positive

Therefore,in an effort to learn more about the artists, the history, the various styles of Reggae music and all the music in between that I missed out on, I searched the many books on Reggae and luckily, came across this book in my local bookstore.

It becomes tiresome to read books on Jamaican music, Rastafarianism, etc. that are written by academics. This book is pure and real, written by people who are the most learned when it comes to Jamaica- her inhabitants.The guide to the top 100 lps that they list is a decent one, as well. Lists, of course, are biased, but I'd rather have the bias of musicians who make the music versus those who don't.If you are, in any way, interested in Jamaican culture and music, then this book needs to be in your library.

Alas, it's quite a disappointment: while the way the authors break down their survey in terms of singles is appealing, the book in general is somewhat lacking in historical and sociological context. At many points it is clear that the authors had a difficult time writing comments for a particular single, and would fall back on rather inane, undergraduate writing-workshop observations. It is clear as well that much of their commentary is cobbled together, somewhat clumsily, from other people's interviews and articles. (The same method is apparent in the artwork, with lots of blurry .jpgs badly enlarged to fit the layout.) The book fares better in the first 80 pages, when the essays delve into more of Jamaican music history. But this is by no means &quot;the best book ever written on reggae,&quot; as they say on the back cover blurb.",neutral

I first became acquainted with the book when I participated in a workshop performance of the book directed by Ms. Swados and produced at the Scholastic Publishing headquarters. While I can understand the hesitation of giving this book to a child as an introduction to poetry from an intellectual standpoint I cannot express how visceral and excited a reaction children who were not old enough to ask, ""what is a poetry slam?"" had to these poems. In my opinion, based my own time sharing these poems with New York City kids, this book is incredibly exciting as an introduction to non-traditional rhythms and edgier more modern young children's poetry.I think that the rhythm and style of the poetry coincides with Cepeda's awesome illustrations and makes for a book that just BEGS to be read out loud.My personal opinion...if you're not ready to FULLY participate in the reading of a poetry book this is NOT the book for you.

However, the poetry, the illusion of a storyline, just never seem to mesh with the awesome pictures.I gathered that these children have fun rhyming in the streets, but this is not the best introduction to poetry. The basics are covered, such as all poems don't have to rhyme. But if I was a child, I would still close this book thinking ""what exactly is a poem"" or ""what exactly is a poetry slam"".

The silly name poem was cute, but really had no purpose in the middle of the book. The poems about the aunt, rain, ice cream, etc. just seem random, and contributes to books overall confusion.

B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,5.0,Intriguing novel of love and its mysterious ways,"One of the last novels by Graham Greene, ""The Captain and the Enemy"" was written in 1988, just three years before the death of the master. Although his prose is as always enjoyable, a little detached and sentimental at the same time, in the novel there seems to be an indication that Greene was aware of the shortcomings of the old age. The books is written in a form of a careless memoir with too many holes in it, no doubt intended ones, considering the contents, but now and then Greene ventures into the reflexive mode of general narration, and I couldn't help but have an impression that I listened to an old man's voice of admission. For a writer, it must not have been easy, but then Greene kept writing all his life, and virtually all of his literary heritage has been revered to this day; a wonder the man had never won the Nobel Prize for literature - another proof that one should not hold too much value in such awards.In a way, ""The Captain and the Enemy"" is full of contradictions, whether intended or not, but on the other hand, this small book incorporates all lifelong passions of Graham Greene, where yet again he touches the multidimensional subjects of interest from yet another viewpoint. The book starts in a humorous way, to quickly transform into a good-natured and intriguing story of a small boy whose life is one great patchwork, him not having a fixed place in the world, with all family connections never materializing themselves. The mother - dead as long as he remembers; the father, or 'The Devil' as everyone is fond of saying - loses the boy in chess, or was it backgammon? The boy never seems to unveil that mystery which no one bothers to tell him. Then there is the Captain, the winner of the game, whatever it was, and his woman, Lisa. As you shall see when you read the book, there is no other way to call her, but the woman. Never in the center of the storyline, although incredibly essential for one's understanding of the novel, Lisa enters the story as abruptly as she does exit, leaving us virtually scratching our heads. Such is the whole novel, in fact, full of mysteries, secrets, blanks spaces, only some of which shall be filled in eventually.One of the greatest strengths of the novel is the portrait of the pair, Lisa and the Captain. Although Greene takes infinite care to never really show us them both, or none of them separately for that matter, it seems to me that the key to understanding ""The Captain and the Enemy"" lies in letting go of the reader's routine, and the yearning for the full explanation, resolution of all threads, explanation one is used to be spoon-fed with. If you accept the fact that the story leaves much to you, all of those blanks to fill in, patchwork to sew together - you are already well-prepared. However, as much as the details are important, the key is to adopt the narrator's viewpoint, or better, the Captain's, if you dare. Why did they live apart from each other all their life, and why it seemed they loved each other dearly, although there's never any real sign of it? Greene was capable of writing a great love story without having his characters ever mention the subject, nor mouth the four-letter word themselves, for that matter. So far away, and so close.""I brought up the forbidden word. 'Does he love you?''Oh, love. They are always saying God loves us. If that's love, I'd rather have a bit of kindness'"" [p. 84]I finished this four-part novel in one day. At first I enjoyed it immensely, but as I read on, I had more and more trouble understanding its real meaning. As the book progresses, we change the scenery and land in Panama of the late 70s, where another part of the Captain's life is revealed, and the book adopts the flavor of an espionage thriller. As I closed the book, I had mixed emotions, and needed to air my head a bit to at least attempt to grasp the full meaning of this novel. Good literature makes you think, and that we can't deny Greene. His novels slowly grow on you, and leave a long-lasting impression and a desire to come back, one day. Which I shall do, and I wish you the same, dear reader.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,5.0,Greene's Last Novel,"I had read a few negative online reviews of this novel, had looked at the the cover (with King Kong standing there), and I had few hopes. I find the book a remarkable book---and just those qualities that some readers disliked were qualities which impressed me. The fact that some characters, most characters here, are not &quot;fleshed out&quot; is just right, for these people exist in a kind of spare landscape of slim hope and love, and they are no more attached to worldly things or even common social interaction, say, Ahab. As much as anything else here (and perhaps because the world depicted is somewhat vaguely suggested), we get the feel of Graham Greene's deep and mature consciousness, for in fact we are roaming around the inside of his mind more than around any landscape populated with Dickensian people (despite what one of the back-cover reviews says). Greene wrote this novel only three years before he died, and I found it a privilege to be in the company of his maturity, his encroaching despair, his sense of bleakness and crassness, all touched by hints of the power of love. It's a book that deserve more attention, and perhaps you need to be a bit older than younger to appreciate it.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,4.0,Graham Greene's Last Novel,"This novel explores the universal human need to be loved and to give love through the eyes of a young boy. The book does not make clear the nature of the relationship of the man (who is called ""the Captain"") and woman with whom he comes to live as a surrogate son. However, this lack of clarity become the focal point of the story. We, the readers, are invited to share boy's thoughts and feelings of not only the boy's perception of what this couple mean to each other, but also whether they love or even care for him. After all, the Captain is frequently absent and then, seemingly, abandons them. The boy even questions if he has ever been loved by anyone or if he is capable of loving another human being. Years later, when he travels to Central America to meet with the long absent Captain, he uncovers not only the type of work that kept the Captain so often away from home, but also how love and deep feelings for another person may exist without ever being expressed aloud. How sad that so many of us can only see this in retrospect, when it is too late.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,4.0,Alone in the world,"This is a minor novel by Greene, although his major themes are here. It was his last and the feeling that prevails is the loneliness of life, the feeling of being a permanent outsider. Victor is the son of a cruel man and a deceased mother, miserably living in boarding school. On his twelfth birthday, instead of his father a complete stranger shows up to pick him up and take him to lunch and maybe a movie. But instead of returning the boy, the stranger, known only as ""The Captain"", tells him he has won him at backgammon, and proposes him to go and live in London. Hating boarding school, Victor decides to go to London, where he is placed in a young woman's apartment, to live there as a kind of stepson. The woman is the occasional mistress of the Captain and former lover of Victor's father. Victor adopts the new name of Jim. The Captain, who is obviously a criminal, appears at increasingly longer intervals. In the meantime, Jim and the woman, Liza, develop a kind of mother-and-son relationship. Eventually Jim grows up and becomes a journalist. When the woman dies, Jim looks for the Captain and finds out he is living in Panama, where he travels to meet him. There he discovers the Captain is involved in drug-dealing.Although this is not at the level of Greene's masterpieces, it is an interesting one to read, because Greene's obsessions are present in a haunting way: moral dilemmas, solitude, the strange relationships we develop with the people our fate brings us close to. Worth a try.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,5.0,"a very spare but not minor novel at all....""what is love anyway?""","Graham Greene's ""The Captain and the Enemy"" is a touching meditation on love that is challenging because of its spareness and the tone in two acts. Among the last things Greene wrote, he has clearly pared this down to the minimum.In the first parts, Greene's stage is the familiar forgotten byways of depressed England, with characters that cling not so much to respectability but mere function in a notch above those on the public dole and in council flats.The story is a love triangle, but the mystery is all why, and perhaps even ""if"" there is real love. All the characters are flawed and warped, and the tale is narrated by a boy-child, who remembers but is not haunted by his mother's death, and also is strangely disaffected by his father's absence and near abandonment in a scruffy public school. He is almost sketched as a person without feelings, and has a tenuous attachment to filial duty: feelings being the romantic form of love, and duty being the mature form of love.Our no-wave anti-hero is plucked from this dull obscurity to go on an adventure writ small: an adventure simply because of its bizarre nature. He is ""won"" by a con-man and sometime associate of his father, and led away from school to live as the child of a broken woman in the basement of an abandoned Victorian home turned into unrented dead-end flats. His life with the woman, the comings and goings of his new foster father ""The Captain"" and the occasional appearance of his father, ""the Devil"" populate his memory in a diary he keeps.In the second part of the novel, the woman has died, and the child, now a young man on his own, travels to ""Greeneland"" the far-away dysfunctional half-colonized frontier land of Panama just before the transition to sovereignty. He must tell his absent foster father The Captain of her death, but cannot bring himself to do so until his own place in the The Captain's life is secured or defined. In this section there is both intrigue and mystery, dark dealings with spies, politics, money, possibly drugs, possibly guns, and a rickety plane. But the real underlying question remains the most pressing mystery: did this most dysfunctional of families made up of such broken people, ever love each other?Clever readers will see that Greene has once again woven Catholicism's deepest questions into the narrative, for the ""family"" mirrors The Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, while ""The Devil"" -our narrator's real father- incarnates a fugitive and absent malevolence as each character gropes emotionally toward the other in an attempt to solidify a sense of themselves as loved, loveable, and capable of love.One of Greene's finest works, and profoundly moving.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,5.0,A wonderful surprise,"Publishers reprinting an author's entire opus are always claiming obscure works have been unfairly overlooked. In the case of ""The Captain and the Enemy,"" that is surely true. Any reader will find all sorts of intrigues in this little-known work. But even for a Greene fan, like me, this was something of a revelation--one also made possible through the brilliant introduction by John Auchard. You'll gain more insight into a complex author from this short novel and new introduction than from three volumnes of most biographies. DGibson from Brooklyn.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,4.0,Unusual story with allegorical depth and intrigue,"One of the most unusual Graham Greene books, The Captain and the Enemy is a concise read with many mysteries and questions. From the beginning we read about a young man being abused by fellow classmates who is whisked away by a man we know as The Captain. We learn he was won in game of either backgammon or chess (we are never sure which) by The Captain against his father who is known as The Devil. Adopted by The Captain's friend and sometime lover Liza, the boy's name changes and he is reared primarly by Liza.In and out of their lives, we get hints of criminal activity by The Captain in spite of what also seems to be several redeeming character traits. Liza obviously loves The Captain as well as the boy and lives a sacrificial life waiting for The Captain and taking care of the boy. Their ambiguous love is a strong theme of the book but is never mentioned outright. Liza dies in an accident and the boy, now a man, heads to Panama to deliver the news to The Captain. In an abrupt shift away from the mystery of the love and the boy's background, we suddenly find ourselves in some kind of political intrigue. Hints of drugs, money, theft, and military interference, we are never sure who to trust or what to expect. As the book closes, we do not know who is The Enemy or even the truth of the situation. The King Kong references must be symbolic but of what? Love? Fear? Power?One possible interpretation of this odd book is that it means nothing and points to some kind of nihilistic but realistic hopelessness. Yet considering past stories of Graham Greene, it is unlikely that this story is about despair. An overriding theme of Greene's books is that of transformation born out of suffering and challenges. When interpreted in terms of how people grow and improve and face their situations directly with honesty and integrity, we find a changed Captain, a changed Jim, and untrustworthy characters around them.The weakness of this book may be its strength. There are many holes and questions and almost non-stop ambiguity about the people and the plot. Readers are left to make their own decisions and their own value judgments on the people and the events. Nobody is fully portrayed and no event is described in detail. Everyone and everything is a mystery and nothing seems to get settled. Reading this book feels like being lost and floating on a rough sea without any kind of goal or direction. But this feeling is also rather comforting in that it tends to represent much of how we experience life. Written by a master author nearing the end of an incredible writing career, Graham Greene may be calling the Enemy old age or death. The Captain may be the elusive but also potentially joyful feeling of love.Highly recommended in spite of its challenges.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,4.0,Interesting Book,"Short and interesting. But I felt like I missed something. Was this book just supposed to present the confusing picture facing the main character, leaving the reader confused too? I'm not sure. Still interesting.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,4.0,Who were these people?,"This was a very different reading experience. The character development is so sparse as to keep the reader at a distance. The Captain is especially enigmatic, and as he is the fulcrum around which all the other characters revolve, it is a challenge to know what to think of any of them. The premise of the story raises many questions of morality, ethics, love and commitment, but oddly it does not really study or explore the issues so much as it leaves the exploration to the reader. In the end, this is not a book for the reader who needs or wants everything laid out plainly and characters who fall into prescribed niches. By seeing the story almost exclusively through the boy's eyes over his lifetime, and as he confesses from the beginning that his memory is not likely to be reliable, we can take little of the narrative at face value. Using our own perceptions of human nature we have to work at figuring out where we are going, and I admit that for a large part of the book I wondered if there was going to be any kind of resolution. There was not a resolution in the traditional ""here's what it was all about"" sense - I never really know who ""The Enemy"" of the title is intended to be. But in the last moments, as Jim reads the last letter from The Captain, we get the payoff. At that moment I thought of Rosebud in Citizen Kane, and as in Citizen Kane, whether all becomes clear or not, a certain understanding is achieved.Kenneth Branaugh was almost perfect in his performance, showing an ability to lend unique voice to each character through cadence and slight pitch changes that felt natural, not forced. In some passages of rapid or intense interaction between two characters, it became difficult to distinguish one from the other, in a couple of instances requiring me to back up to catch up. A minor and only occasional flaw, and not enough to reduce the rating.",positive
B000HWNJVI,The Captain and the Enemy,4.0,Chance encounters,"The Captain And The Enemy is one of Graham Greene's late works. Like most of his novels, it is quite short, deceptively intense and, despite what might appear to be a quite literal plot, highly enigmatic.Then captain of the title is a man we hardly get to know. His name might be Smith, or Baxter, or even anything he might have noticed in passing that morning. His title might be captain, or colonel, or sergeant, or even plain mister. Doubtless he had been Lord at some point. He can become anyone he wants, but at heart he's a pirate, sailing alone through life in search of elusive treasure. One day he was whiling time away with an acquaintance, a man always called The Devil, playing backgammon (or was it chess?). The stakes rose and The Devil wagered his son. The colonel won. The book opens with the colonel claiming ownership of Victor Baxter, then a boy at a boarding school. The colonel abducts the boy. They both agree that Victor is a naff name and from then on the boy is called Jim.At home, if home it be, is Lisa, the woman to whom the captain continues to devote his life, even if the norm is devotion from afar. Lisa gets irregular cash or cheques through the post to cover the housekeeping and never questions the source. The Captain, of course, never offers anything more. Jim, as the lad Victor has become, becomes part of the insoluble equation. He keeps a journal for some reason and, discovering it years later, he embarks upon an edit.And then Jim is grown up and in search of the man he now calls his father. He left Lisa and the household years before in search of fortune. Jim tracks him down to Panama and discovers a strange life packed with intrigue. When they meet again, Jim finds a changed man, someone he hardly recognises. Jim's response is to lie to him.The Colonel is eventually revealed as a man with principles, principles worth personal risk. At least that's what he says today, and who ever knows about tomorrow?And so we are left with memories of people who live towards the edge of even their own lives. They adopt identities bestowed by circumstance and change apparently at will. Who cares about contradiction? I mean really cares?",positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",2.0,A Path More Traveled,"""On the occasions when Lewis came to the Northmoor Road, the children liked him because he did not talk condescendingly to them; and he gave them books by E. Nesbit, which they enjoyed. But with Edith he was shy and ungainly"" (Carpenter 1977:159).""Lewis was popular with the Tolkien children, never talking condescendingly to them and giving them books by E. Nesbit which they enjoyed, but he was shy and ill at ease with Edith"" (Pearce 1998:52-53).Joseph Pearce's ""Tolkien: Man and Myth"" provides a glimpse of Tolkien's faith, crucial in understanding his mythologies. Pearce states, ""to employ a lisping pun, Tolkien is a misunderstood man because he is a mythunderstood man"" (Pearce 1998:XIII). But this is not a deep investigation, and the beautifully written book by Humphrey Carpenter,J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, is the unwitting blueprint for Pearce's book. In areas describing Tolkien's life, Pearce repeatedly lifted whole sentences out of Carpenter's biography without consistent citation. There is very little rewriting of the material utilized or borrowed. Pearce's commentaries on Anglicanism and Catholicism are interesting. But insightful exploration of Newman's influence on Tolkien's faith is almost entirely missing, as is any in-depth description of Tolkien's faith practice, or the flavour of English Catholicism during his mother's life, or at while at work in Oxford. It may be worthwhile to slog through Pearce's repeats of Carpenter's words to get to some critical analysis on Tolkein's Catholic faith that Carpenter missed; maybe the author will do a better edit in the future. The intended subject matter is worth it.Pearce criticizes Carpenter and the supposed ""shallowness of Carpenter's approach"" (Pearce 1998:22), which draws attention to connections between the books. Carpenter: ""She was remarkably pretty, small and slim, with grey eyes, firm clear features and short dark hair"" (1977:46). Compare the Pearce version: ""She was very pretty, small and slim, with grey eyes and short dark hair parted in the middle"" (1998:26). Carpenter: ""In fact she was illegitimate"" (1977:46). Pearce: ""In fact, she was illegitimate"" (1998:27). Carpenter: ""But traffic was limited to an occasional farm cart or tradesman's wagon, and it was easy to forget the city was so near"" (1997:28). Here is Pearce: ""Traffic in the village was limited to an occasional farm cart or tradesman's wagon so it was easy to forget the proximity of the industrial city"" (Pearce 1998:14). As you follow paragraphs, this goes on throughout the book. The examples are too numerous to mention here, as whole biographical chapters clumsily outline Carpenter's, topic by topic, with several sentences at a time used in the same order, unchanged or barely altered in Pearce's work. The author should have known that Tolkien researchers might have more than only his book on hand whilst reading about Tolkien and his fascinating imagination. I am amazed that the publisher is unaware of this incursion, however possibly unintended, into Carpenter's work.Even if this wasn't a problem, Pearce skips over Tolkien's WWI experience, missing an important narrative in the formation and expression of Tolkien's faith and later works. He tries to force-feed G.K. Chesterton down Tolkien's creative throat, while Tolkien the philologicist invented languages; he likely found much of Chesterton's verbiage overwraught and clumsy. He found GKC's language filled with ""smash and glitter...mere loud colors"" (Carpenter 1981:92). As well, Pearce's description of how Tolkien aided Lewis's conversion is far more limited that the lucid and beautiful argument more fully described in Carpenter's work. Carpenter's book contains a great deal more detail on Tolkien's whole life, his service in WWI, student years in Oxford, and teaching. The real examination of faith is contained in Tolkien's letters, which Pearce does use, but a better source for these, yet again, is contained in Carpenter'sThe Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien.",negative
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,Excellent. Highly Recommended,"Pearce's work is an excellent achievement. It is half biography, and half literary analysis and review. For those familiar with Humphrey Carpenter's work, this book will serve as a very important second lens, a second perspective from which to appreciate the fiction and life of J.R.R. Tolkien. Although Tolkien himself intensely disapproved of biography as a way of understanding one's creative fiction (admittedly the real sparks of inspiration are never easy to track down; educated guesswork is all we can manage with some help from the author and friends), Pearce has accomplished a very readable work which will give readers a deeper appreciation of the life and influences of J.R.R Tolkien.

Mind you, I am not saying that Tolkien's religion did not influence his writings, but there were other things as well. I was looking forward to a new biography, but this was not the one I sought. The flaws in Carpenter's biography which Pearce and other reviewers on this page seem to dwell upon ought to be obvious to any of its serious readers anyway. I think one would be wiser to stick with Carpenter, the letters, and Tolkien's works. When it comes down to it, this biography relies too heavily upon block quotations from these, and, as a result, there was not enough new scholarship.

0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",1.0,Likely to disappoint,"This book was written as a result of the Waterstone's (a UK chain of bookshops) survey of 1997 where LOTR was voted the &quot;greatest book of the century&quot;. Many readers and critics responded rather - shall we say - negatively to this result. It seems that they did not think that LOTR was the &quot;greatest book of this century&quot; - in fact they thought that in many ways it was not a very good book at all. One of the objectives of Pearce's book is to refute these criticisms and to arm defenders of LOTR with useful ammunition when they come up against its detractors. Unfortunately, the best that Pearce can come up with is this ancient chestnut, precised thus: &quot;Any flaws you think that you find in LOTR are not in fact flaws in the book but in yourself. You are not adequately equipped - spiritually, morally or intellectually - to criticise this book.&quot; This blatantly dishonest line of reasoning is an insult to the serious-minded and intelligent people who have found flaws in LOTR. It is also likely to embarrass those who use it when advocating the book's merits as it is so easily demolished. In this sense, Pearce betrays those readers who look to him with help in articulating the reasons why they consider LOTR to be &quot;the greatest book of the century.&quot;On the positive side, Pearce usefully recycles his previous research into G K Chesterton and provides an interestingly Catholic viewpoint on a Catholic writer. It seems a shame, though, that he doesn't make more use of the contact he had with Owen Barfield just before his death, as the Inklings material in this book adds nothing to what others have written previously.To finish; this writer sides with those who consider LOTR to be a good book - it has many virtues, but its failings are also many, if not fatal. It is certainly not &quot;the greatest book&quot; of this or any other century.",negative
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,A study to find the real Man behind the Myth: Tolkien,"&quot;The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work&quot; (Tolkien, in a letter to Robert Murray)These words might not be to the liking of many Tolkien critics, analysts or pseudo-writers that have been trying to unravel the Tolkien Myth. I believe that many of them have been at least partially unsuccessful due to the simple fact that they underestimated or totally overlooked the main essence of Tolkien's life which was his spiritual faith as a Catholic.Of course, this is by no means popular for a writer. Indeed , being a Catholic can mean instant &quot;unpopularity&quot; in certain cases; a paradox considering that Tolkien is by all means an extremely popular personality. Probably popularity has been helped by misunderstanding the man as a consequence of so many superfluous opinions by wrongly called &quot;Tolkien experts&quot;.It is thus with great enthusiasm that I read this essay by Joseph Pearce. It is a well documented and objective work that reaches on to the very deep roots of Tolkien's motivations and perceptions of the world which were based on his Christian beliefs and his life as a convinced Catholic.The essay begins with a lively description of the turbulence caused when several reader polls established Tolkien as &quot;The Author of the Century&quot;. Although this is an interesting (even fun) part, the most valuable comes from the rest of the book where we discover a proper view of Tolkien as essentially a Catholic author. Pearce , convincingly achieves this through an impartial presentation of documents, facts and original testimonials that permits us to glimpse the &quot;Real Tolkien&quot;.Written in an agile and practical style, it permits a clear and pleasant reading without falling into the usual dull academicism of many essays.I consider this, along with &quot;The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien&quot; a most illuminating source to enjoy and truly understand the creator of such beauty as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Regarding beauty, let me end quoting Tolkien again: &quot;...Our Lady, upon which all my own small perception of beauty both in majesty and simplicity is founded&quot;",positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,Tolkien the Devout,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the man behind the LOTR, The Hobbit, and the Silmarillion. Largely based on Tolkien's own letters, as well as perspectives from critics, friends and family, Pearce's book offers a fresh and insightful perspective of Christianity's influence on Tolkien's philosophy and use of myth. I have seen no other work that provides such an articulate and well documented linkage between the man's faith and his works. Pearce succinctly and effectively dismantles claims that Tolkien is either reactionary or escapist, while furthering the case that the creative genius is one of the most important and influential authors of this century. As a Christian, I am inspired by Pearce's description of Tolkien's Theocentric approach to life and to his work. Traveling in Christian &quot;fundamentalist&quot; circles, I too often see Tolkien's name associated with occult and New Age activity. Of all criticisms leveled at the man and his works, I'm sure that these unfair allegations would hurt this devout Christian more than all others. Only a profound misunderstanding of the man and his myth ( and Myth, in general ) could lead to such a confused opinion. T:M&amp;M also educated me as to the profound impact Tolkien had on his fellow Inkling, C.S. Lewis, the renowned Christian apologist, whose own works, including the Narnia tales ( which were heavily influenced by Tolkien), are staples in every Christian bookstore. And yet Tolkien's name is often pronounced with contempt in Christian circles. Again, this book may help to silence this kind of calumny. Furthermore, Pearce's book has prompted me to read the works of G.K. Chesterton ( another noted apologist ) , as well as more of the letters, essays, and unfinished tales of Tolkien himself. T:M&amp;M reminded me of my early days as a born again Christian. Having discovered Tolkien two years before I &quot;discovered&quot; Christ, I now recall the odd sense of familiarity and recognition when I read the Bible for the first time. At the time I simply attributed this to a primitive recognition of the Truth which is hardwired into the hearts of all men. I still believe that, but I also recognize that I was &quot;remembering&quot; my previous experience with Tolkien. His myths were just as he had intended them - a variation on the theme of the &quot;True Myth&quot; of Christ Jesus. Thanks to Mr. Pearce for helping me recognize this.",positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",4.0,4 1/2 stars...an essential companion,"The truth is that ""The Lord of the Rings"" didn't just win in one poll, it won in several, and Tolkien himself won ""author of the century"". What really upset the literati was that he won again, and again, and again. Burned 'em up, it did. What this said was that ""The Lord of the Rings"" was not 'the greatest' book of the century, but it was the one people loved the most, the one they cherished and gave their children, the one that had the most meaning for them in the quiet places of their hearts. Which hurt the establishment even more, I expect, and which leads us to Mr. Pearce's book.Part of the problem with writing biographical material now nearly 30 years after a seminal biography (and a dozen or more literary critiques) have come to press regarding one of the century's most popular writers, is that it's all pretty much been said. So don't be surprised when Carpenter's excellent and justly famous biography is footnoted many, many times. This isn't meant to be an entirely original biography. The biographical section does in 4 pages what Carpenter does in 40 - this book is about something else. Tolkien distrusted traditional biography and doubted very seriously that just because something happened to an artist that it was necessarily important to him or her. Tolkien's own list of the most important events of his life and art is pretty short...the Catholic Church and growing up in the pre-industrial English countryside. Not much there for a biographer to go on, seemingly. But Mr. Pearce wisely lifts these and a very few other aspects out of the white noise of every life and uses them to illuminate the life and work of a singular and impressive man. His unshakeable Catholic faith, his tireless devotion to his family, his love of the unspoilt countryside: there you have Tolkien in a nutshell. It's Pearce's assertion that many modern readers don't really want to hear all that. Often looking more for excuses rather than examples, they want to know all the cracks in the plaster. What were his indiscretions? His debaucheries? His infidelities? Was he gay? What is most important is that, even after losing both beloved parents in childhood, spending a difficult and poverty stricken youth moving from one shabby apartment to another, struggling to obtain an education, losing two of his greatest friends in the meat grinder of the Somme in WW1, making it home himself by sheer luck, he remained decade after decade a tireless and devoted father and husband, a fount of instruction for generations through his teaching, and the writer of one of the most entrancing and beguiling works ever to be written in the English language. He didn't devolve into a drunk or a wife beater as did many another self absorbed artist dealing with his ""issues"" or carrying around post traumatic stress. So where's the fun in reading about him then, you ask? Pearce's delightful book shows how Tolkien did it, how he lived the life he did, based on the things that were important to the man himself. And Tolkien ought to be allowed an opinion, don't you think?",positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,Concise Summary of a Man and His Great Works,"J.R.R. Tolkien's work and life have been misconstrued by critics who never understood a modern man's devotion to faith. He was misconstrued even by his &quot;authorized&quot; biographer. Pearce pierces through the crusts of insult and mischaracterization of Tolkien (the first chapter reprints some of the fiercest critical comments by those who lack the imagination to see past the mundane in literature and who write &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; off as a childish fantasy), and his study is an excellant overview of Professor Tolkien's life and works. Though Pearce's book can be read in a day, it has sufficient grounding and insight to explain why Middle-Earth is so full and satisfying when so many other very-well-thought-out subsequent fantasy worlds appear hollow. This book is must for Tolkien's fans and for anyone interested in the intertwining of faith and literature; and a quick, fun, and enlightening read for anyone interested in twentieth-century literature, who is undogmatic about what that literature must be. Those who brand religious faith (particularly Tolkien's devout Christianity) as irrelevant and/or literature as nothing more than a tool mirroring their own Nihilistic mindset will not understand this book at all. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; will probably be read into the Fourth Millenium, and this fine study of its author dispenses with the patronizing and pseudo-Freudian claptrap that so often surrounds Tolkien and his sub-creation like a dreary fog, directing sunshine into areas many critics and academics wish were left foggy.",positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,Tolkien: Man and Myth,This is an excellent look into J.R.R. Tolkien's life. Joseph Pearce tries (and succeeds) to explain the works of Tolkien by looking at the beliefs the man held. This biography especially focuses on the Christian faith held by Tolkien and how that factored into the development of his philosophy on life and life beyond death (and hence into his fictional works). A very interesting read if one is curious about the man behind such wonderful literature like the Lord of the Rings. It also does a fantastic job of showing how friends and acquaintances helped encourage him to keep writing (particularly C.S. Lewis). Highly recommended.,positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,A Very Full &amp; Readable Account,"When choosing which biography to read on Tolkien, I chose this one because the author seemed to have great respect for Tolkien...so great that he was willing to take on the intelligentsia of England. As Pearce explains, in 1997 a poll was done in England to see what the best books of the century were. When &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; turned up on top, the literary critics all over England (as well as the professors) were up-in-arms. They thought the craze for this work had come and gone. They thought that Tolkien only had a small, cult-like remnant left to his following (Tolkien's official biographer being among these scoffers). They condemned this work on many fronts.And so another poll was taken...and another. But, no matter who did the poll and how, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; kept turning up on top. What horrified the &quot;experts&quot; even more was that Tolkien himself was voted as the best author of the century. What could possibly be contained in his works that led to such unanimous support from the people and such criticism from the experts?That is what Pearce explores in this well-crafted biography. And, if you like Tolkien, you have to admire Pearce's approach from the beginning. He knew that Tolkien despised pop-psychology type biographies that tried to analyze an author's works based on his upbringing and life's events. Thus, while giving a sketch of Tolkien's life, Pearce respects Tolkien's wishes to not be dissected psychologically.Rather, Pearce took on the rather large task of helping laymen understand how Tolkien's faith - a particularly Catholic faith - influenced his writings. When I first read &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; myself, I wondered how one man (Tolkien) could come up with all the depth expressed in this work. (For instance, I was in awe of the depth of the idea that Sauron could never anticipate Frodo's journey to DESTROY the ring because Sauron was so evil that he couldn't anticipate selfless acts.) What Pearce helped me realize was that much of the depth came from Tolkien's reading the likes of St. Augustine and other church fathers. I believe that Tolkien himself would say that he stood on the shoulders of Giants in order to get anywhere near the understanding he portrays.In addition to such fascinating accounts of how Tolkien's faith manifests in his work, Pearce has a particular knack for addressing subjects that a reader would be curious about...without ever going too far. In this book, he writes about such things as Tolkien's marriage, his work, his experience in WWI, his friendship with C.S. Lewis, his critics, and his advice to his son when his son was getting disillusioned with the church. In all these things, Pearce gives you a full picture while retaining a delicacy for the the people involved.As someone who wanted an overview of Tolkien and an understanding of how his faith intersected with his life and work, I felt I had found the perfect source in Pearce's book.",positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,An Insightful Look Into A Rich Life,"The further I delved into Tolkien: Man and Myth, the more I realized that calling it a ""biography"" is a misnomer. I came to this conclusion because only a minor portion of the book presents biographical information. Instead, the book could better be described as a work of ""apologetics"". Apologetics, in its most classic sense, uses writings and examples to both clarify a philosophy and refute critical comments about that philosophy. This method is exactly what Pierce employed to near perfection in Tolkien: Man and Myth. Pierce uses the writings of Tolkien and others to refute the criticisms of Tolkien's works. In the process, he provides the reader with a thorough understanding of the philosophy that shaped Tolkien's writings, how Tolkien arrived at this philosophy, and how it influenced his interactions with others. The result is a deeper appreciation for Tolkien's efforts.Pierce deserves much credit for using the writings of the ""man"" to dispel many of the ""myths"" surrounding Tolkien and his books. By taking an apologetics approach to Tolkien's life and works, Pierce provides the reader with a better understanding of his subject than any standard biography could provide. Consequently, Tolkien: Man and Myth is an essential work for anyone studying the life of this literary giant.",positive
0898708257,"Tolkien: Man and Myth, a Literary Life",5.0,A good contribution to understanding Tolkien's books.,"Few writers have inspired such extremes of opinion as J.R.R. Tolkien and the work that has become synonymous with his name, the fantasy epic &lt;I&gt;The Lord of the RingsPearce looks at the whole of Tolkien's work and at key events in his life as a guide to unveiling how Tolkien made sense of the world around us. He gives us the understanding of myth that lies at the heart of Tolkien's Middle Earth, the elaborate, sub-created reality that is the home of &lt;I&gt;The Lord of the Ring'selves, dwarves, hobbits, and men.Though the tale of Tolkien's public reception is by no means the focus of the work, he does devote a fair amount of attention to weaving the fascinating tale of both the approbation and opprobium surrounding the critical and public debate over &lt;I&gt;The Lord of the Rings.He finds that the contention has often generated as much heat as light. More importantly Pearce gives us--straight from Tolkien's pen--the two things that Tolkien's fans take delight in and that so many of his critics have been missing all along:&quot;[T]here are a few basic facts, which however drily expressed, are really significant. For instance I was born in 1892 and lived for my early years in &quot;the Shire&quot; in a pre-mechanical age. Or more important, I am a Christian (which can be deduced from my stories), and in fact a Roman Catholic.&quot;To be sure, Middle Earth gives no explicit mention of Christianity, thus seeming to contradict Tolkien's claim in the above quote that &quot;my Christianity can be deduced from my stories. Pearce shows that, nonetheless, an orthodox Christian understanding of the cosmos is the cornerstone of Tolkien's &quot;subcreated&quot; reality: Man (or elf, or dwarf, or hobbit) was created by God (the people of Middle Earth call him &quot;Iluvatar&quot;--the All-Father), and through the rebellion of Morgoth (aka. Satan) and his temptation of man, sin and death entered into the world.",positive

Pearce's book delves into the reasons why Tolkien developed the art he did while avoiding teh overly Freuden' psychological pitfalls of reading too much into the subject.There are no deep secrets here, just good common sense by listening to Tolkien's life, letters and writing. One gets to pierce Tolkien's Middle Earth and his Roman Catholic life and how is religious faith ineteracted with everything he did, from his marriage to his friendships.

B0008C0IYS,Select practical writings of Robert Traill,4.0,A Covenanter Preaches,"Let me start with the edition. This Kessinger reprint is about average for their quality. There are a few pages with smeared text, but all are still readable. And there is one page missing. This is a reprint of an 1845 edition, which had updated the language for that time. So this book uses modern grammar and spelling.Traill, 1642-1716, was the second of that name to serve as a Covenanter minister in Scotland. His father had been banished to Holland, and the younger Traill joined him there briefly, before going to England. He was ordained by Presbyterians in London, and served in a congregation in Kent. During a visit to Scotland, he preached to a small gathering of visitors in his home, and was arrested for holding a conventicle (a private religious meeting, a capital offense during that period). He spent three months at the Bass Rock, before being released after the intercession of friends in England. He then returned to Kent, but was later transferred to London.This book is a collection of Communion sermons from his Kent and London days. He preaches form an orthodox Calvinist perspective from Galatians, Hebrews, Isaiah, Matthew, Ephesians, Philippians, and I Corinthians. He uses the very searching style of preaching that was standard for that time. Also according to that standard, he is also very wordy, and is a little tedious to the modern reader. However, the teaching is well-ordered and profitable, filled with pithy analogies and quotable passages. I recommend putting in the effort to read him.",positive

096273750X,A Manual for Structured Group Treatment With Adolescent Sexual Offenders,5.0,Review from a therapist treating adolescent sex offenders,"I am a therapist currently working in a residential program in Wisconsin. I have worked with this program for nearly five years. In that time I have treated adolescent male sex offenders ages 11-19. I see the kids intensively, sometimes up to three times per week. I am always looking for new resources and have come across some very useless, uninformative, and complicated resources. There are very few resources for adolescents that take age, cogintive functioning, and other basic treatment needs into consideration. Most offer a ""cookie cutter"" approach which, as anyone who works in this field knows, does not work with the wide range of treatment issues and needs this particular population presents. I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS BOOK!! I watched the publication date get pushed back repeatedly and I was growing increasingly frustrated and ended up buying a really old and outdated version of the book and it was a complete waste. I continued to wait for this book and it has been worth the wait. There are so many positive things about this book that I am not even sure where to begin. But I will try to sum this up:1) There are enough group activities in this workbook to last for weeks on end. If you run a weekly treatment group this workbook will prepare you for many, many upcoming sessions. For those in a time crunch and do not have a lot of time in between group sessions to prepare consider this book! You won't be sorry!2) Each activity is easily adaptable and offers very user-friendly explanations of the purpose, how to present it to the group, suggestions of how to adapt if desired, and clear instructions how to engage the group. I had group two days ago and ten minutes before it was to begin I realized I had not prepared anything. I grabbed the book and chose an activity and it was a very productive group. Everyone participated, challenged one another, and felt they were contributing to our ABC's of treatment activity. What more can you ask for?3) These are fun and useful activities that everyone can enjoy. Working with teenage boys is often like playing dentist. Pulling teeth. But with these activities I have found that no matter how big or small the group the goofier I am the more the boys will lighten up and at least show some interest. I have yet to lose a group member due to boredom or acting out when using these activities. Does it get any better than that?4) The group is broken into different stages of treatment. For those just beginning treatment the early activities act as icebreakers and easily draw the newer kids into the process and group. And for the veteran group members who have perhaps already done the activity, or something similar, they can call upon their knowledge to teach and show leadership which has noticeably improved their self esteem and increased their motivation. Plus they get to ""show off"" which is a huge priority for teenage boys. Everybody wins then! The activities geared towards later stages of treatment are excellent as well. I find that because of the varying levels of ability and points in treatment each of my clients are at some of the activities are best used on an individual basis which works equally well.5) I have seen positive outcomes. I have heard first hand several of my clients refer to specific activities from this book that have been used in group as one of the three activities that they have found most useful for themselves. Not the most enjoyable, but the most useful and one that helped them learn about their issues and needs. That is what treatment is all about.This is a book that should adorn any therapist's desk if they work with any child or adolescent that has sexualized behaviors. I have used some of the activities in another group I facilitate as well so it really covers a lot of issues and topics. I am so pleased with this book and I truly could get rid of almost all my other sex offender treatment resources and use this one almost exclusively and still feel I can address all the treatment needs of my clients. Buy this book. You have my word that it is worth every penny.",positive

B000H2MN0Q,Spiral: A Novel,5.0,A smashing debut! Now when's his next book coming out?,"Richer than Croesus and sicker than Lazarus, Laverne Taubman prefers to die slowly from gum infections rather than allow anyone to look inside her mouth. After the bizarre murder of painter Frank Spira's former lover, Jacob Grossman, obsessed Spira biographer Nicholas Greer learns that Taubman may hold clues to Spira's missing and mysterious masterwork, Incarnation.Greer is ushered to Taubman's bedside hoping for answers, but receives only anger as Taubman becomes incensed over the same subject that caused Grossman to break his own nose against a mirror. Her last words to him about Incarnation --- ""He died for it, and you will, too"" --- nonetheless fail to convince the less-than-successful writer to cease his search for the painting.Taubman is just one of the finely detailed characters in Joseph Geary's assured first novel, SPIRAL. Another is Tony Reardon, who is also one of the ""Spira's Lovers"" Greer contracts to write about for the New York Times. Still another is the shabby police officer who interviews Greer since he was Grossman's last visitor and made a recording of their conversation. When the NYPD target Greer as a suspect, everyone soon realizes that the shabby officer was someone completely different.It's difficult to describe any other steps in or stages of Geary's plot without threatening to rob readers of their own pleasure in being sucked into his fictional vortex. The author combines a chilling study of high-stakes high art dealing with a murder mystery, an action story, and a portrait of an artist as a young madman --- not to mention the portrait of another artist, Greer, watching his life and psyche unravel as his involvement with Incarnation deepens.Broke and alone (his wife leaves him early on), Greer has been researching Spira for six years. With his 900-page biography finished and on an important publisher's desk, he at last stands the chance of success. But after interviewing the long-missing Grossman and learning that a work Spira created in Tangier in 1957 may still exist, Nick uncovers a series of sex, lies, and even videotape (well, 8mm film). As he begins to understand the significance of Spira's great work, he also comes under scrutiny from Oscar Nagel, an important Spira collector.Geary keeps the pace up, moving between New York, London and Tangier, as Greer becomes more entangled in shady art-world dealings and more confused by Spira's even shadier past. So often, suspense and thriller protagonists are fabulously polished humans destined to meet and love other fabulously polished specimens of the opposite sex during their adventures. Nicholas Greer is anything but polished; he would be more accurately described as shambling and disheveled. He is also disorganized, jealous of the competition, and ill-prepared for the events and people he encounters.Geary also manages a delicate balance between scenes of Greer's search, the NYPD's investigation, and Nagel's machinations, alternating scenes of furious momentum with those of slow frustration. The d&eacute;nouement will fascinate even readers who have cannily deduced Spira's (and Taubman's, among others) chilling secret. Waiting for Geary's next book will seem slower than death by dental abscess.--- Reviewed by Bethanne Kelly Patrick",positive

Nick obsesses over finding the painting, but also wants to stop the murderer who has killed other Spira associates, but &quot;the collector&quot; has different plans that include using Nick to obtain the Incarnation for him.This is an exciting mystery that works on several levels that include an intriguing serial killer who-done-it, a clever biography subplot, and an insightful art mystery. Nick is a great protagonist, whose obsessive personality is costing him his personal life, leading to the audience to wonder when he will get a real life. Anyone who reads this superb debut novel will feel sorry for author Joseph Geary because improving on this tale seems impossible.Harriet Klausner",positive

I've always loved reading about magic, the occult, the supernatural and all things strange and after flipping through a few volumes I knew I had to have the set. I have a vague memory of seeing a few of the covers as a child, but I didn't really have pre-knowledge of the set. As others have said, the volumes are profusely illustrated with artwork and photos, and each topic is covered well. You can check the bibliography if there is particular entry/topic you wish to learn more about. I should mention, that this is not some surface treatment like you might see in other encyclopedias. I can imagine sitting for hours upon hours just going through each volume. I paid a fraction of the cost that I see here on Amazon Marketplace, and they were in pristine condition.

0451201469,The Yorkshire Lady (Signet Regency Romance),4.0,Adventure and romance = pleasing combination,"When a tall, gawky young woman who has no social skills meets a suave French count, sparks are bound to fly. Especially when they would appear to be total opposites to each other in every respect. Height would seem to be the only commonality between Rachel Barton and Yves St. Armand.A good bit of this story is set in Yorkshire, the home of Rachel, who is a mill-owner with advanced ideas about the welfare of her workers. Because of her height and plain face, she has given up on the idea of a husband and children, until the Earl of Fairborne becomes enraptured with her--and her fortune. He works hard at convincing her that she should become his countess, even going so far as to bring her to London for a visit.It is here, in the earl's house, at midnight, that Rachel first meets Yves, who has entered the earl's bookroom searching for evidence against a traitor to the English cause. Yves is a secret agent who has determined to seek revenge for the death of his French fianc&eacute;e, as well as many British soldiers. In spite of himself, he is drawn to the intelligent, dowdy woman who finds herself drawn into the search for the traitor.This is a very satisfying book, longer on adventure than romance, which is not a bad thing. The characters are very believable and if Rachel was a bit before her time, well--there have been many others in that position as well.",positive
0451201469,The Yorkshire Lady (Signet Regency Romance),4.0,The Yorkshire Lady,"This novel centers a little more on it's intrigue/adventure plot than it does on the romance between the two pricipals, Rachel Barton and Yves St. Armand. Having said that however, I must add that the book still makes for some truly enjoyable reading. Rachel Barton is an exceptional heroine -- intelligent and self reliant, brave, outspoken and warm hearted. And Nadine Miller does a wonderful job of allowing Yves St. Armand to transcend the mould of typical hero -- Yves manages to change from an avenging knight to someone who sees that there is more to life than revenge and that Rachel just may be the person to share that life with him.The novel opens with Yves being warned by Lord Castlereagh that he is making too much noise in his search for the English traitor who had betrayed him and almost cost him his life. Such work must be handled delicately and with stealth. Castlereagh has narrowed down the suspects to four men, and asks Yves help in discovering which of the men their likely traitor could be. Both men settle on the Earl of Fairborne and the most likely candidate and the one that Yves will investigate first. The Earl in the meantime has been courting a rich Yorkshire mill owner, Rachel Barton. Rachel is currently a guest at his London house. A sensible woman, Rachel soon comes to realise that while she is much charmed by the Earl, that that is not quite enough to base a marriage on, and has some serious doubts as to whether they would suit each other at all.One night Rachel walks in on an intruder in the Earl's bookroom. Rachel thinks that she has walked in on a burgular, a burgular whose kisses makes her senses reel. Later, she discovers that the burgular is actually a rich French nobleman. Rachel's vivid imagination leads her to believe that Yves is a French spy up to no good. Yves cannot believe that Rachel would think the very worst of him and loyally stick by the Earl, and while he is angered by her assumptions, her loyalty to the Earl also wins his grudging admiration. Yves manages to persuade her that he is not England's enemy, but he has a much more difficult time trying to sell Rachel the idea that the Earl could be a traitor. Loathe to believe the worst of her friend, Rachel agress to asssist Yves in his investigation, if only to prove that the Earl is no traitor. What will Yves and Rachel discover in their investigations? Will the Earl prove to be the villain Yves believes him to be? And will Yves finally cease protesting that Rachel is not his 'type' and admit that his feeling for her are alot warmer than he will let on?I liked this book for it's not quite in the usual mode heroine. I'll admit I'm partial to the 'not quite in the usual mode'. The romance between the two principals did take a back seat to search for the traitor for a while, but then the romance did gather momentum, and was, I think on the whole, very deftly managed. Reading of how Yves comes to slowly realise his true feelings for Rachel was truly satisfying. Nadine Miller's writing style is crisp and to the point, and there are no extraneous plots or characters to throw you off your stride and make you wonder what exactly is going on. An excellent book, worth recommneding.",positive
0451201469,The Yorkshire Lady (Signet Regency Romance),1.0,"blah, blah, blah","I think the other reviewers went into the plot of this regency with great detail so I will not go over it agin. However, I disagree that this was a good romance. I did not like this story at all. The story does have lively dialogue. I actually like our gawky, tall millowner, Rachel Barton. The problem is....Rachel is a &quot;bean pole&quot;, vastly unattractive, dowdy when it comes to dressing, just utterly unattractive. Our hero, St. Armand, is gorgeous, probably the most gorgeous man Rachel has ever see, plus a practiced flirt and rake. Well, why not - he is a hunk of a man. That is the problem. I felt sorry for Rachel. The author goes to such pains to physically describe her poor looks that, yes, it is silly to think St. Armand would fall so quickly in love with her. Yes, she is smart. But not that smart. In the beginning, she did not believe anything he told her and she was silly in her continued belief, after much obvious proof to the contrary, that the Earl was a good guy. Hello Rachel...And any female who fell in love with such a handsome man would take some time to improve ones appearance. The French hat maker gave her some pointers. She did not take them up. I realize many romance writers are writing romance tales for readers who probably look like Rachel too. But be real. St. Armand might have, in time, come to appreciate her intelligence and generous heart. After time. But he would not fall in love at first sight. It would have been more realistic to have her burn those stupid brown dresses. Rachel deserved better than to be described by all of London as a dowd. She would have been very uncomfortable with Yves on her arm with him so superior in looks. She did not have to be a beauty, but style would have helped. And the author gives her none of that either.",negative
B00085ZJL2,Samuel the Seeker,4.0,Another Sinclair classic,"Samuel the Seeker is a tongue in cheek version of a Horatio Alger book. Samuel starts off life as a naive farmer's boy who must leave home to find work in New York. Unfortunately, he never makes it to the big city and is waylaid in a medium-sized town that has problems of their own. He finds that employment is tough to find and that the odds are stacked against him.Samuel's adventures mirror those of an Alger book. He finds employment by saving the life of a rich person. He is happy working there until he realizes the debauchery his employer practices. This goes against Samuel's Christian upbringing and again he hits the street in search of work. Ultimately, Samuel learns that the world isn't a friendly place. The church only offers minimal succor and fails to punish and correct the wealthy members who cause the poor misery.While the events were a bit hokey like that of a rags to riches Alger story, Sinclair's identifying of many social ills are crystal clear. Fans of Sinclair will enjoy this book as well as those who are interested in social injustices and socialism.",positive
B0007EDJC0,Eagle forgotten: The life of John Peter Altgeld (Charter Books),4.0,"Readable, if Exaggerated, Bio on an Important &quot;Progressive&quot;","The title of Harry Barnard's biography of John Peter Altgeld was inspired by Vachel Lindsay's poem &quot;The Eagle That is Forgotten,&quot; which commemorated the life of Altgeld--the former governor of Illinois. In this spirit, Barnard presented a highly sympathetic account of the governor's life and contribution to American politics, and at times exaggerating his accomplishments.Sometimes mistakenly branded as &quot;one of those German revolutionists of 1848,&quot; Altgeld was born in southern Germany December 30, 1847. His family arrived in a farming community of Richmond County, Ohio when he was three months. After serving as a substitute in the Civil War at the age of sixteen, Altgeld was filled with new aspirations and ambitions that prompted him to travel west where he soon would enjoy a rapid rise in American politics.Algeld was the governor of Illinois during a very important period in its history. He is best known for pardoning the three surviving Haymarket defendants and quashing some of the labor unrest of the 1890s. Barnard described Altgeld as a &quot;law and order&quot; governor during the Pullman strike. Altgeld encouraged labor to strengthen itself through organization, however, he would not tolerate any threat of violence on the part of labor agitators. Altgeld also palyed a pivitol role in the 1896 Democratic convention. Barnard maintained that every plank in the 1896 Dmocratic platform was revolutionary and entirely the achievement of the Illinois governor.Barnard presented a clearly-written account of John Peter Altgeld's political career. He effectively placed Altgeld within the context of the general issues facing the nation. These issues included the Granger movement, economic depressions, the labor question, and the debate over currency.In considering Altgeld's role within the general history of the United States in the 1890s, one can find many problems with Barnard's analysis. Barnard credited Altgeld for the demise of President Cleveland, however, the 1893 depression and Cleveland's role in the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act were, most likely, more instrumental in the decline of Cleveland's influence in the party then were his ongoing tiffs with Altgeld. Cleveland's defense of the gold standard alienated him from the southern core of the Democratic party. Moreover, Barnard admitted that Altgeld cared little for the currency question until 1894. Altgeld may have dominated the 1896 platform; however, he was unable to prevent the nomination of William Jennings Bryan (Altgeld supported Richard Park of Missouri). In addition, the role of the Illinois governor may have been elevated because the convention was held in Chicago.Barnard presented convincing arguments to refute a number of traditionally held views regarding Altgeld. Chief among these views was the belief that the Haymarket pardons ruined Altgeld's political career. Barnard clearly demonstrated that Altgeld remained very strong in the Democratic party during the 1896 convention. He cites poor health, a desire to leave politics, and the hard work spent on Bryan's presidential campaign at the expense of the gubernatorial race for Altgeld's failure to gain re-election. The fact that Altgeld died only eight years after the pardons may make it difficult to access the actual effect the pardons had on his career.The biography is, for the most part, well-written with an excellent use of primary sources; however, it is often overburdened by long quotations which interupt the flow of the reading. An exchange of these long quotes for more information on Altgeld's day-to-day gubernatorial record would make this work more complete. Still, it is an essential source of information on an important figure in American Progressivism.",positive
B0007EDJC0,Eagle forgotten: The life of John Peter Altgeld (Charter Books),4.0,A Review of Eagle Forgotten,"The life of John Altgeld was, as the cover of my copy of this book says, ""turbulent"". Harry Barnard does wonderful job in this book of portraying Altgeld as a hero of the working class. In my work on my undergraduate thesis this book has been extremely helpful. I am attempting to define Altgeld in my thesis and this book provided much evidence for Altgeld being a progressive leader in an era that was filled with corruption. This book was written in 1938 which is both a blessing and a curse. It is awesome because it was written by a man who lived in the same time period as Altgeld, but it also makes it a little harder to read and fairly dry. The biggest qualm that I have with this book is that it only paints Altgeld as a hero and touches very little on some of the more sinister things that he did. Overall, the book is a very good read and provides a very detailed telling of the life of a controversial figure. It is written by a man of authority in the area of Illinois history and would be a very helpful addition to anyone studying Altgeld or even the Gilded age in general.",positive

1574670182,Bbc Music Magazine Top 1000 Cds Guide: A Critical Guide to the Best Classical Music Cds,4.0,Older recordings bu still useful.,"I have been a reader on and off of the BBC Music Magazine since it was first issued. I had worn out my copy of the NPR Classical guide [well worth getting]The NPR Guide to Building a Classical CD Collection : The 350 Essential Worksand went hunting for some good review books. This is one of several I ordered. It was published in 1996 so a lot of the releases that are recommended have been reissued on other versions, but it is fairly easy to do a quick search to find the recommended recordings. If you are familiar with the 5 star performance/sound ratings from the magazine, you will not find that here. I guess the theory is that they are all 4-5 stars.The recommendations are for one recording for each work. While that may make it easier for some, it would have been nicer if there had been at least a few for each work. As it is, they seem to suggest some good recordings, although I would not agree with many of the suggestions as a 'First Choice'. As a guide to help expand some recordings in your collection, or to find out about works that you did not know about, it is quite useful. The writing is fairly clear and to the point, without the flowery prose that some of the other books out there use. All in all an enjoyable read, and a decent resource for recordings up thru the 90's. As always, there is a UK-centric bias to some of the suggestions [I mean Elgar is good an all, but a dozen works recommended?] and those old British conductors tend to get recommended a lot. I cannot say that the works/performances they recommend are bad by any means, but would not discount another recording from its lack of a review.Stats: The book is organized into 5 parts, Chamber Music, Choral and Song, Instrumental, Opera and Orchestral, with an alphabetical composer listing in each section. Label, pricing and recording time are all listed, with 3-4 works per page, so concise but not too short reviews for each work. The number of composers is good, spread out from baroque to modern, with a good mix from every era.As a very useful book, and probably cheap used, it is definitely worth the purchase. I would rate it closer to 3 1/2 stars, but will give them the bump up.",positive

0253302803,An African World: The Basongye Village of Lupupa Ngye,3.0,An Ethnographer's Ethnography,"I first heard of Alan Merriam many years ago, as one of the foremost ethnomusicologists in the USA. Not being very familiar with the field, when I saw his book, AN AFRICAN WORLD, in a bookshop some years ago, I bought it right away, without looking through it. I've just read it. I was disappointed to realize that it had nothing to do with music, but that is hardly the fault of the author !This study of a small village in Eastern Kasai in the country now known as Congo, but for many years as Zaire, is written about a sub-division of the people known as Basongye. Merriam undertook to write it because ""...music can only be understood when society and culture are understood and thus that understanding can only be achieved along with a general ethnographic competence."" The village of Lupupa Ngye, described in mind-boggling detail here, serves, then, as a typical place in a larger Basongye society, whose music Merriam must have described elsewhere. I found Merriam's writing very clear and extremely well-organized. His data seems amazingly complete as well. There are a few interesting photographs included and the historical introduction is excellent, the most interesting part of the book to me. However, three factors lead me to say that I think few readers would find this book a pleasurable experience, unless they were students of Central African history or anthropology, in which case AN AFRICAN WORLD would surely be absolutely necessary. First, Merriam loaded his text with literally hundreds of Kisonge terms (and even gave the plurals in most cases !). This breaks up the text considerably. I doubt if many readers, even the most earnest, need to know that ""fate"" was called ""kwelampungulu"" by the villagers. Second, Merriam seems to have had a laundry list of a huge number of traits, characteristics, and institutions found among the cultures of mankind. Could these have been taken from the old HRAF system ? [Human Relations Area Files] I found it a little annoying to be told very often that such and such custom or habit is not found among the villagers. It smacks of Monty Python. Third, and last, this is an ethnography for the record. It stands as (I would bet) one of the few ever written about the area, an area that has doubtless gone through, and is still going through, the cruel vicissitudes of civil war and national breakdown. But the villagers have no voice in the book. We meet nobody, we hear nobody, we feel nothing. Merriam connects us to no anthropological theory, he is totally absent from his work---we don't know what he felt about any of it, we don't learn much about how he did the work. It is a steady march through the List. Magic, sorcerers, agriculture, kinship, hunting, the political system, oaths and ordeals, marriage, divorce, death, slavery, social groups, funerals...... I missed feeling, I missed compassion, I missed drama. If you are researching the Congo or Central Africa, you must read this book. If you are searching for a book that will give you pleasure, look for something else.",neutral

067972611X,Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5.0,An Easy Read with Power and Dark Humor,"If I were pressed to use one word to describe this book itwould be dark. However, Crane's novel is a moving piece with momentsof transcendence and rampant dark humor.Basically, it is the story of Maggie, an undeveloped character who takes the back-seat to her loud and abusive parents, her swaggering, self-confident brother Jimmie and his friend, the boastful Pete.The novel chronicles the injustices that surround Maggie, who is quiet and doesn't fight back. A chilling look at poor, urban life in the late 1800's, it is also a tale critical of society's judgmentality and questioning of morality. A more complex novel than it seems on first look, it is wonderful to take apart and examine the relationship between Maggie and Pete, Maggie and her mother, and Maggie and Jimmie.Most importantly, however, are the quiet moments of transcendence in this novel.",positive
067972611X,Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5.0,A Blossom in a Mud Puddle,"I reread Stephen Crane's ""Maggie: A Girl of the Streets"" yesterday. It was the first time that I had revisited the book in almost thirty years. Originally, I read Crane's writings in a seminar course which compared his pioneering works to those of Ernest Hemingway. There were common themes in the works of both authors and they both employed a naturalistic style. Crane was more poetic, however, while Hemingway was more workmanlike in his choice of words and phrases.This tragic story takes place in the slums and the garment district. Maggie is the daughter of two alcoholic Irish immigrants. Her youngest brother dies during early childhood. Her older brother spends his youth fighting rivals in the streets and enduring beatings at the hands of his intoxicated parents at home. In adulthood, Jimmie becomes a teamster and introduces his sister to his friend Pete, a well dressed local bartender. Pete is taken with Maggie's shape and begins courting her. Eventually, Maggie quits her five dollars a week job at the cuff and collar factory and leaves home with Pete. This ill considered decision is the beginning of her ruin. Pete cares nothing for Maggie. She is a only a passing fancy.Environment determines everything in this sad tale. Alcoholic rages and casual acts of random violence occur on almost every page. Crane employs dialect to reflect the speech patterns of his characters. When Pete abandons Maggie for Nellie, a stylish prostitute, the saddest line of dialogue is Maggie's question: ""Where kin I go?"" Disowned by her widowed mother, who is herself a frequent defendant in the police courts on account of her drunken behavior, and brother, whose own relations with women are not much better than those of Pete, for having gone to the devil, Maggie begins walking the pavements alone and becomes one of the scarlet legions.Initially, Crane had to self publish this book since it was considered to coarse and profane to print. It proved to be unprofitable and he gave many copies of the limited first printing away. Unlike ""The Red Badge of Courage,"" there is no place for heroism and redemption in the Bowery streets inhabited by Maggie, Jimmie and Pete. This sad account of an unfortunate woman driven into a life of prostitution is far removed from the nightly celebrations at the opulent Everleigh Club.It is humbling to think that Crane was capable of creating such a novella while he was scarcely over the age of twenty and that all of his poetry and prose was completed before his death at the age of twenty-eight.",positive
067972611X,Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4.0,Naturalism to the tee.....,"Stephen Crane does a superb job of displaying the qualities of Naturalism in this story. He focuses on the lower classes, deals with an amoral set of ideas/decisions, displays a blatant attack on false values, a reformest agenda, imagery that is either animalistic or mechanistic, and a plot of decline that often leads to catastrophe through a deterministic sequence of causes and effects. Crane attacks both the romantic idealism and the moral posturing of the church in this novel. The animalistic imagery, displayed in the Darwinian landscape of Rum Alley, is significant, for it reinforces the work's naturalistic orientation: humans are viewed as extensions of the animal kingdom engaged in a Darwinian struggle for survival. This novel assails the hypocricy of the priest who offers condemnation instead of compassion, who claims to help people, yet turns a deaf ear to their pleas for help, and whose moral posturing encourages others to do the same. BRAVO! Crane....If you would like to discuss this novel in greater detail, email me.",positive
067972611X,Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4.0,The underbelly of New York at the turn of the century,"If Edith Wharton captures the snobbery, superficiality, hypocrisy, materialism, and coldness of New York City's turn-of-the-century elite, Stephen Crane reveals the toughness, callousness, brutality, and violence of New York's working class. Ironically, Wharton's Lily Bart and Crane's Maggie Johnson, both romantics moving in anti-romantic spheres, share a similar fate--abandoned by their respective societies.Unlike Wharton, Crane wrote from a primarily journalistic, dispassionate point of view. The settings, the situations, the speech, and the similes reveal the underbelly of life among the working poor. Maggie opens with ""a very little boy,"" her brother Jim, serving as ""champion"" of Rum Alley, an aptly named area where life is centered on working, drinking, and fighting.Maggie and Jim's father can't keep him from fighting because that's all the boy knows, and the torn clothes that his drunken mother bemoans cannot compare to the furniture and crockery damage that occur during their violent marital spats. The father, a drunken brute like his wife, does not understand the irony of his demand when he says, "". . . Yer allus pounding 'im . . . I can't get no rest 'cause yer allus poundin' a kid. Let up, d'yeh hear? Don't be allus poundin' a kid."" The infuriated mother responds with increased savagery. ""At last she tossed him to a corner where he limply lay cursing and weeping."" Jim, Maggie, and even the baby Tommie seem to be as disposable as the rest of the household goods.Life in the city is lived outwardly, and the strong do not question themselves. While ""Jimmie had an idea it wasn't common courtesy for a friend to come to one's home and ruin one's sister,"" his contemplations of his own actions toward women are cut off by self-absolution before such introspection can lead to self-incrimination. Later, Pete will share this attitude when Maggie attempts, in his mind, ""to give him some responsibility in a matter that did not concern him.""Maggie and Jimmie's parents represent an extreme. Everyone knows their family's business, from the residents who share their tenement with its ""gruesome doorway"" to the group of urchins who waylay the mother as she is ejected from a saloon for ""disturbance."" The Johnsons' troubles delight the neighbors; the old woman downstairs tells Jim that ""deh funnies' t'ing I ever saw"" was Maggie ""a-cryin' as if her heart would break, she was. It was deh funnies' t'ing I ever saw.""In the midst of this squalor, Maggie does have an inner life. Combined with her romanticism and navet&eacute;, it convinces her that Pete is the height of urbane sophistication as he bullies waiters, telling them to ""git off deh eart'."" Interestingly, as she toils over ""eternal collars and cuffs,"" Maggie has a daydream that foreshadows Pete's final chapter in the novel; she imagines him with a half dozen women ""and thought he must lean dangerously toward an indefinite one, whom she pictured with great charms of person, but with an altogether contemptible disposition.""In Maggie's final appearance, Crane does not use her name, which perhaps answers her question from the preceding chapter: ""Who?"" She begins her anonymous journey near a theater district, where the affluent emerge from ""a place of forgetfulness."" Her wanderings on this one night reflect her life over the previous several months, as she leaves behind the bright light and glamor on a trail of rejection that leads ever downward, until she meets a wreck of a human, who follows ""the girl of the crimson legions."" No longer Maggie, she represents those whose naivete, hopes, and foolish romantic dreams are crushed by the code of toughness that Jimmie fights for at the beginning and the hypocrisy that her lamenting mother exhibits at her fall.These stories can be hard to read, partly because most of the relationships seem detached or distant at best and bitterly heartless at worst. Maggie's father talks about pounding ""a kid"" as though they are not his own and have nothing to do with him. Pete is ""stuck"" on Maggie's shape only until she gets in the way of greater desires. George of George's Mother is happiest when he has made his old mother miserable. At the same time his ""friends,"" whose habits and exhortations have led to his downfall, abandon him, just as he turned on his mother.Love is a rare visitor to Crane's pages, apparent mostly in the maternal indulgences of George's Mother and the rediscovered affection of Mr. and Mrs. Binks in ""Mr. Binks' Day Off."" It is only in the countryside of New Jersey that the battling Binkses find a moment in which to express genuine affection: ""Mrs. Binks had stolen forth her arm and linked it with his. Her head leaned softly against his shoulder.""Notably, the other loving relationship, between a child and ""A Dark-Brown Dog,"" is marked by the brutality of the one and the submissiveness of the other. Their friendship begins when ""the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head""; the dog ""sank down in despair at the child's feet."" In the world both know, the more powerful must domineer, and the weaker must submit. Living by this simple rule, however, does not guarantee survival.Crane self-published Maggie, and it is sometimes clear that his work could have benefited from an editor's counsel. For example, similes such as, ""The little boy ran to the halls, shrieking like a monk in an earthquake,"" are ineffective and draw too much attention to themselves. Yet these stories are an amazing accomplishment of observation and writing that make Crane's premature death at age 28 even more tragic.",positive
067972611X,Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,4.0,A City In Fragments,"The world of Stephen Crane's Manhattan doesn't exist any more, a fact for which we can be grateful. It's a world where poverty, alcoholism and disease were not only rampant but blamed entirely on the victims.Crane was no humanist; he was content to record the depravity around him with a keen eye and a cool heart. In his mind man was but passing flashes of cosmic debris, and his New York stories, written in the first half of 1890s and collected here, capture the jagged pieces of life he saw with unblinking candor. ""War Is Kind"" was the title of a collection of Crane poems; this collection of stories could be called ""Man Is Not"".In ""When A Man Falls, A Crowd Gathers"", we have a tale of urban rubbernecking before the age of the automobile. A man collapses on the street, and a throng soon surrounds him, gaping hopefully for the sight of death and trodding on each other's toes. ""An Eloquence Of Grief"" covers a young lady accused of prostitution realizing no one cares about her plight in the cold recesses of a busy courtroom.""The Men In The Storm"" sets us amid another throng, this time a huddled mass seeking shelter beneath a blizzard: ""Then a dull roar of rage came from the men on the outskirts; but all the time they strained and pushed until it appeared to be impoosible for those that they cried out against to do anything but be crushed to pulp.""That's about the lot of everyone in these stories, sadly, from the title character of Crane's first novel ""Maggie"" to a small dark-brown dog who finds temporary shelter with a small boy and his thoughtless family. For Crane, originally from upstate New York, Gotham in the last decade of the 19th century was a frightening place, hellish because it placed people in such close proximity to one another.The stories collected here don't necessarily work in isolation, though ""A Dark Brown Dog"" remains a sentimental favorite of mine when I feel tough enough to read it and ""George's Mother"" works very well as a story of a shortsighted woman and her wayward son. But reading them in tandem here gives you a sense for what it was Crane found so fascinating and terrifying. Even a lighter piece like ""The Broken-Down Van"" feels fabulously unreal in Crane's hands, almost dreamlike in the way the narration jumps around without rhyme or reason among drivers, spectators, drunks, and a cop.The character of Maggie makes a cameo in ""George's Mother, and the book's Introduction by Larzer Ziff states flatly that three of the other stories - ""Dark-Brown Dog"", ""An Ominous Baby"", and ""A Great Mistake"" - also deal with Maggie's family. That seems a reach to me, though it's true Crane's characters feel oddly connected with one another, even when they are of different station. The children in ""Mr. Binks' Day Off"" have the same first names as Maggie and her siblings, though they couldn't be farther apart socially.It's been said that Crane was both Naturalist and Impressionist when it came to his art, and that case is well presented in this collection. Miserable as man's condition may be, boring it's not, and Crane is as good a representer of that reality as anyone.",positive
067972611X,Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5.0,"A bleak uncompromising novel of New York's ""lower depths"".","This is a great book,I love this book,though it is almost unbearably sad.The novel's uncompromising realism in its portrayl of stunted,wasted and degraded lives in the New York tenements of the 1890's,horrified many of Stephen Crane's contemporaries,and he initially had to pay to have it privately published(it was his first novel).Only when he became famous as the author of ""The Red Badge of Courage"",was there a proper edition.Crane railed at ""sentimentality"",which he saw as an artistic curse.There is no sentimentality in this book,and Crane proved that a good writer could still move the reader to tears without purple prose.",positive

Some of their values seem kind of quaint and rustic as compared to 100 years later, however the realism is staggering. One can feel the despair of a terrible life that never gets better. Death and disease are the only fates that await and there is no release.This is not just a book to be read as an assignment, read it for the realistic view of history as a slice of life to understand what New Yorker's were going through then, and as a parable to ghetto life today.

067972611X,Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,5.0,A Dark Look at 1890s Slum Life,"American novelist Stephen Crane (1871-1900) is familiar to many readers due to his Civil War classic The Red Badge of Courage (1895), which is standard fare in most high school literature classes. Less familiar, however, is Crane's first novel, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893), written when the author was only 22 years-old. In this work, Crane chronicles the tragic descent of Maggie, the novel's young heroine, which is propelled by the pernicious effects of the hellish slum life of late nineteenth-century New York City. The author, normally described as a ""naturalist,"" did indeed base this work on his own detailed observations as well as those of the crusading journalist and photographer Jacob Riis (author of How the Other Half Lives). Nevertheless, Crane also imbues Maggie: A Girl of the Streets with ample doses of symbolism, biblical allusions, and even melodrama. This masterful amalgamation of literary styles allowed Crane to create a harrowing but heartfelt depiction of the debilitating effect of impersonal societal forces on the individual.This ""Norton Critical Edition"" of Maggie: A Girl of the Streets is richly endowed with insightful essays concerning the author and his craft. Some of these, for example, provide crucial biographical and contextual information concerning the development of Crane's social and religious views; others examine the author's usage of irony, satire, symbolism, and American naturalism in the novel.

0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,5.0,A Moving Story,"Having read some of Andrew Harvey's later works, I was interested in this autobiographical account of an earlier period in his spiritual development. Harvey was born in the only place that could have matched his romantic spirit and spiritual imagination: India. At the age of nine, he was sent to be educated in the very different environment of England. Feeling abandoned by his parents and struggling with his own homosexuality, Harvey grew up to be a depressed college professor who one day decided to chuck it all and return to the land of his birth, in search of... he wasn't sure what. As a Christian with little background knowledge of Hinduism, I found Harvey's relationship with Mother Meera a bit problematic--but recognizing my cultural bias, I decided to read the book with an open mind. I found myself deeply moved by the story, recognizing in it my own struggles with spiritual surrender. Harvey's experiences may seem unusually intense to some readers, but those familiar with Harvey's work will expect nothing less from what they know to be an intense and passionate personality. This poetic book reveals the root of much of Harvey's thought that will deepen and mature in his later Christian writings.",positive
0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,4.0,Hidden journey: A spiritual awakening,"The first half of the book is a real adventure as the author seeks spiritual fulfillment. The second half tends to drag-on as he takes the reader through many of his effulgent experiences.The story is about the authors experiences with Mother Meera, however She steals the show. I had never heard of her before but for me her authentic power shines through everything that is written in this book. If read with a genuine search for the truth it can change lives for ever.",positive
0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,4.0,"Captivating, In the worst possible sense.","After you read this book, you must read The Sun at Midnight, in which Harvey completely renounces what he has so passionately advocated here. I have the sense that both books are a form of spiritual exhibitionism. In his later book, he comes to realize how much he was projecting onto Mother Meera. But even reading this book, the careful reader can see that most of what Ma (as he calls her) says is actually not even said by her. A typical conversation with her goes something like this:Ma sits and looks at her hands. Her eyes are aflame. Her head glows.Andrew says, You want to tell me that I must love you even more.Ma: Yes.Andrew: You want me to know that you have been sent to change the world.Ma: Yes.Well, gee, whose ideas are these anyhow? The projection is there for anyone to see.And so is the narcissim of the author, and if anything, it actually seems to get worse when he renounces Meera. He seems to think that his suffering because of her demand that he leave his lover is on a par with the crucifixion of Christ.I have tried to winnow the wheat from the chaff in reading Harvey, because he is a skilled writer and also has studied and experienced a great deal of mysticism. What I garner from this book is an imaginative understanding of what it would be like to worship God-made-flesh. The attempt to think that this obviously human person here before me is at one and the same time Divine, an incarnation of God, makes me consider what the 12 apostles might have felt. Or did they?At the time of his denounciation of Meera, Harvey believed that she had actually been practicing black magic and witchcraft upon him and all her followers. You won't find any hint of that here, but knowing it as you read will give a different color to everything in the story.",positive
0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,5.0,"Great Book, but Read His Later Ones","I really enjoyed this book a ton, but its message should be taken as only a small part of Mr. Harvey's spiritual journey since he eventually left Mother Meera (something that seemed unthinkable if you read &quot;Hidden Journey&quot;)because she was intolerant of homosexuality. (This is certainly an aspect of an &quot;enlightened&quot; being which I totally don't understand! ) Still, this is a fascinating and unique story, and very well written.",positive
0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,5.0,Powerful first person account of personal awakening,"This reviewer is aware of the authors current equivocation about the book but believes that whatever private agreements or disagreements he and Ma may have is their personal business and do not belong in the review. The book speaks for itself as it was written.I have looked at a sampling of his other autobiographical works and find that this one far and away outclasses them all. The others might as well not even exist in my mind. The author is a very curious and intense thinker and cannot resist the spiritual smorgasbord that this planet has to offer.The author was born and raised in India and had in my view the great good fortune to have been guided to Pondicherry while attending Oxford classes as his first real immersion into a spiritual quest. There he joined other meditators from the Aurobindo ashram at Aurobindo's tomb.After his meditations:""Two nights before I left Mahabalipuram I was strolling at midnight along the moonlit curve of beach to the hotel, when all at once my mind split apart, like a coconut thrown against a wall, and everything, instead of being deliciously and warmly outside, was now inside. The wind was inside me and the sea pounding and the sand under my feet, and the whole wild softly pulsing creation was singing with one voice OM distinctly and unmistakably, a resounding horizon-to-horizon curling, vibrant, rich OM that was sounding within me. It took whatever scrap of mind I had left to remain standing, to stagger on. There was a complete separation between whatever consciousness I was now in, seeing and reveling in this vastness, and my body tottering on the sands, barely able to hold what it had been given. I had flowered far above and around and beyond my body and was connected to it by only the most fragile of threads, only just strong enough to drag it forward, like a piece of driftwood. I had enough mind left to gaze at the hulls of the boats around me, at the nets lying on the sands, at the sands themselves, at my feet; everything was still in its old shape, but shimmering with a soft milky light. I remember, absurdly, blinking again and again to see if the vision would go away, but the roaring OM went on, and the light kept breaking from my feet and the sands around them.""He also met Jean-Marc Frechette, someone who spent a lot of time laughing at him and whose ""gift to me--for which I will always be grateful--was to live the spiritual life before my eyes with such a happy simplicity I could not deny its truth. Jean-Marc had given up all `normal' life for a small room with a badly working fan by the sea in South India. He had almost no money, no job to go to, no ring of friends to sustain his choice--nothing, in fact, but his faith, his few books of Claudel, Rene Char, and Aurobindo, and the sound of the sea. Yet he was the clearest man I had ever known, spare, joyful, delight fully eccentric..."" Jean-Marc had a sophistication that made for strong bond of fellowship. Later Jean-Marc would be the one to introduce him to Mother Meera (Ma) at the early age of 17 just as her guardian presented her to the public in 1978 at Auroville. (Now she now lives in Thalheim, Germany) She was born enlightened.. Because of his strong academic background and powerful ego, it took about 12 years for his awakening which is richly detailed in the book. The author became a friend of the family, specifically Mr. Reddy, her guardian and her friend and helper Adilakshmi.""It was early evening. Darshan had been unusually long--two hours. Jean-Marc, I, and an American were standing outside the door of Meera's apartment putting on our shoes.The door opened with a sharp clack. Still in the brilliant red sari she had worn for darshan, stood Meera alone. All around her, as she stood there gazing at us with a passion I had never seen before on her face, was a blaze of Light--white diamond Light--all the brighter for being in the darkness of the doorway. I began to tremble and perspire. The Light streamed from her; her skin was a deep fiery gold; her eyes blazed, vast and abstract, like two bonfires in the darkness. The Light was of the same pure, piercing whiteness that I had seen in the vision Aurobindo had given me the year before. I gazed at it around Meera, hardly able to believe what I was seeing. That it emanated from her and not from any other source was unmistakable; beyond any doubt I was seeing with open eyes the Divine Light and Meera burning in it.We all three saw the Light, simultaneously, together, and were unable to move or say anything.Slowly, with profound tenderness, Meera turned to each of us and transformed herself before our eyes. She turned to Jean-Marc and became immediately the Goddess of his inner dream--warm, sensuous, smiling, her head tilted slightly. She turned to the American and seemed to melt, visibly, into another shape--to grow taller, older, to become hieratic, and grave with the majesty I had seen in her when she appeared to my inner eye as the Queen of Heaven. Then she turned to me. Her face seemed to detach itself from her body and swim, burning, back and forth in the air before me. There was nothing but her face. I did not know whether it was separate from me or within me; all sense of distance was obliterated. The Light became more and more intense, so bright that it took all my strength to go on looking into it. The face was smiling--not gently as it had to Jean-Marc but with a tigerish, exultant smile, a smile of absolute triumph. She gazed deep into my eyes; my whole body filled with flame. In the seconds of that gaze I was only my eyes and this Fire.The three of us had, as if in a dream, raised our hands to salute her. Meera became ""herself"" again and raptly saluted us each in turn. The humility of this gesture pierced me even more deeply than the glory of the smile she had given me. She was saluting, I realized, the divine Self in each of us. ""You, too, are this Light that I am,"" her gesture told us. ""You are Me and I am you and we are inseparable forever.""Then she bowed her head and closed the door quietly.""This is powerful stuff and the book is filled with such descriptions, particularly closer to the end. He recounts many personal dialogs he had with Ma and became her personal English tutor when she moved to Germany.""I know in a poem everything would go beautifully and quickly. But real processes are not quite like that. There is a lot of crisscrossing and staggering and sheer error. You make an advance, then you fall back and hit your head on the floor again. You have a run of exquisite, perfect days, and then you repeat all the old rubbish. It takes time to get the hang of it. It's a little like playing a complicated piece of music. You have to practice bits of it at a time, over and over again, with discipline, then slowly put it together and play it all through several hundred times until it becomes as natural to you as breathing in and out, or taking a leak. Ma's is a revolutionary method and works fast. But don't think it is easy. Even if the Divine Light is beaming at you, sometimes you feel, I just can't take any more of this. I want to go out and get drunk. The ego holds on to its pleasures, its silly doomed pleasures, with a tenacity that would be touching if it were not so deadly.""In the book he clearly credits Ma as his inspiration and spiritual mentor and attributes his progress to his association with her, but she says:""Humanity must work for that [evolutionary] leap. Humanity must become conscious. Aspiration is everything. Aspiration and work. My help is always given, my help and my light. But humanity must work....Humans want God to do everything. Humans have to do something.""He gives a hot log analogy of the value of a guru. ""St. John compares the soul to a log of wood that has to be first penetrated by the fire and then consumed in it. The log is initially always dank and dirty and has first to be prepared by the fire before the Fire can enter it."" Then he relates this to his personal experience.""The Fire is a mirror in which all the cruelties and subtle madness of the ego are seen, with no possibility of evasion or consolation. I lived again through my long betrayal of Her, all the ways I still looked to use or evade her, the grief of my sexual and creative life, the sullen hypocrisies I had cherished in myself.Throughout this agony I could never forget everything I knew of Her Mercy. I knew a power as loving as hers would never wound except to heal; would never strip me unless to clothe me in richness and splendor; would never make me cry out again and again in grief unless the death this brought was to prepare an infinitely wider life.""Meera makes no claims of exclusivity, in fact, ""There are others who are also doing divine work....I am not interested in ashrams. I am not interested in founding a movement for people who do not want to work, who want only to sit around and think about what they think is God. I want people to work. People should go on living their ordinary lives. Family life is a very good place to do my work. It teaches people to be unselfish. I want people to be strong, self-reliant, unselfish, and to contribute to the world with whatever skills and gifts they have. I want them to work--with my light behind them....The important thing is to pray and to receive light. That in itself changes everything.""",positive
0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,5.0,A classic account of a guru experience,"I love the detailed and specific ways in which Andrew Harvey writes about his experiences on a spiritual journey which appears to be aided by his guru, Mother Meera: but see the later autobiographical work, Sun at Midnight, to get another perspective on Meera.One of the refreshing features of both works is his extreme honesty about character defects, one of which is the tendency to overly dramatise situations; in Hidden Journey, he quotes in depth from a Frenchman he meets on a beach in southern India who makes sharply critical but also very amusing remarks about Harvey's tragic, operatic take on life. But it is this, plus a developed literary style, which makes his writing so readable (better than most novels I've read); and, to put it bluntly, we all have defects: and perhaps we don't see our own as clearly as Harvey sees his; and, to get metaphysical about it, it is by forgiving the faults we see so clearly in others (the mote in the brother's eye!), that we begin to release our own.",positive
0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,4.0,If God Were One of Us,"Hidden Journey reminds me of the Joan Osborne song ""If God Were One Of Us."" It tells the story of Andrew Harvey's nine years of spiritual growth while a pupil of Mother Meera, an woman who claims to be an incarnation of God on Earth. He meets Meera at the Aurobindo ashram in Pondicherry at the end of 1978 when he is 27 and she is 18. She has been brought there by Mr. Reddy, an Indian who had been seeking the Mother Goddess his whole life and discovered Meera when she was an 11 year old servant in his in-laws' home.The book is more about Harvey's mystical journey, but people interested in Mother Meera will also find the book useful. He describes her silent meetings with followers (darshan) where she first holds the devotee's head in her hands and then looks into their eyes, supposedly imparting her grace in this process. Also her early life in India and Thalheim Germany are presented, but in a very subjective way through the practice of Mr. Harvey.Since Mother Meera is silent during her public appearances, much of what we learn of her is from question and answer periods that Harvey held with her in private. However, even these are presented basically as leading questions by Harvey to which Meera agrees. The other method that Harvey uses to reveal her thoughts is through Mother Meera's voice in Harvey's head. He presents Meera as being able to communicate with him telepathically and many discussions in the book, presented in italics, are of this nature.Another large portion of the book is devoted to the mystical gifts of visions and dreams that Harvey gets from Meera during his spiritual progress. Many of them are of glowing radiances, golden glows, and other lights. While these and other unusual occurences present a very lively and dramatic view of the mystical path, I found them repetative and skipped over a lot of them.The book does present how an average human being with a fair share of personal problems can make spiritual progress through mystical practice. However, although Harvey made lots of progress, one gets the idea that he still has a way to go.",positive

0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,1.0,Enuf of Guru's and the parasites that feed off of them!,"I did a little research of my own in trying to determine the value of ""Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening"". During my search I found some extremely disturbing items about the Author's apparently unquenchable need to find ""Guru's"" and at the same time make lots of money writing about them. He then some time after publishing these ""spiritual classics"",finds instead that these same ""Guru's"" aren't really very spiritual at all. Does he however remove any of these bogus texts from circulation or refund any money to the hapless readers he helped mislead? The answer is apparently not! Instead he sets off on yet another spiritual quest and invites you to pick up the tab once again for another of his ""spiritual journeys"" by purchasing even more of these bogus new-age tomes until perhaps he becomes disillusioned with another spiritual dead end!Now it appears that he's set about re-visiting the Gnostic texts and medieval Christian spiritual practices. I guess he's learned from his previous employer's that what he really needed to do was just set up shop for himself! He's now the bold, new, self-styled re-interpreter of these ancient Gnostic texts and sees himself as a fresh, new-age seer who can delve into their deeper meaning!It would appear,that in the past, Mr. Harvey had previously spent over 10 years with a ""Guru"" named Mother Meera, and that in reality he actually knew very little of substance about her. She apparently eventually turned on him (even after he was instrumental in making her a star in the particularly bizarre world of Guru-dom) and she utterly demoralized him when she demanded that he end his long-term Gay relationship and marry a Woman and also give her the credit for transforming him into a heterosexual. He reports he was absolutely devastated.I can't help but wonder however during the time he was presumably worshiping at her feet, couldn't he have found the time to at least inquire as to her actual beliefs regarding homosexuality? Did she really change up on him suddenly, or was he so carried away by his own need to feel enlightened (and then write bestsellers about it) that he chose to simply overlook any troubling contradictions he may have previously noticed? According to his own account he soon after apparently also made the identical error w/ yet another "" mystic"" and presumed ""Ascended Master""Sogyal Rinpoche who was later charged w/ sexually abusing his devotees. The simple fact remains that he (Mr. Harvey) really doesn't sound too discerning at all, does he!When you're two for two in picking straight up ""spiritual"" charlatans and frauds to guide you but at the same time make a lot of money writing counterfeit ""Spiritual Classics"", about these bogus guru's and their dubious teachings, maybe you just ought to find a more honest line of work.",negative
0140194487,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening,1.0,Big Infant With Mother Fixation Starts To Grow Up,"Andrew Harvey, having regained his senses somewhat, writes of his period of blind devotion to Mother Meera as follows:""I'd been so battered as a child and so disappointed in love in my twenties and thirties that I thought the only relationship with any hope was the kind of exotic, intense, subtly sadomasochistic relationship I had with Meera.""Meera, Harvey said, fulfilled his desire for the perfect parental relationship which his own mother could not provide. (Mother Harvey packed Andrew off to boarding school when he was eight and he just couldn't take it.)Concerning Meera and gurus in general, Harvey writes:""A lot, perhaps most, of those we now call 'enlightened gurus' are nothing of the sort. They are not divine or divinised beings at all, but extremely powerful occult manipulators, who through certain kinds of spiritual exercises have attained certain siddhis, or powers, which enable them to dominate the minds of others. They masquerade as 'gods' giving 'experiences' and doing 'miracles'. Mother Meera simply wanted me to remain her devotee and to go on using me, and her lies prove she is not enlightened (to say the least).""Harvey continues:""I believe that we are at the end of the guru system and that its current abuses disqualify it from the business of serious spiritual transformation. The next five years will see a blizzard of financial and sexual scandals which I am certain will make this point painfully clear even to those who now believe implicitly in the guru system and are prepared to fight dirty to preserve it.""Harvey, who was instrumental in setting up Mother Meera's ashram in Germany, now has some misgivings about these 'places of devotion'. Ashrams, he writes, are ""lunatic asylums, filled with jealous and needy people.""Andrew Harvey has made it clear in a number of books and articles that he now regards Mother Meera as nothing more than a charlatan. Harvey is, of course, only one amongst many millions of Westerners who deceived themselves into believing that a guru or some other charismatic figure from the East possessed the solution to the mystery of life and its problems. In retrospect, Harvey's book is useful inasmuch as it warns us against adopting this silly belief as well.Another book which is extremely useful for this purpose is 'Feet Of Clay: A Study Of Gurus' by Anthony StorrAnd watching the BBC documentary 'The Secret Swami' which investigates accusations of child sexual abuse levelled against the Indian guru Sai Baba won't do you any harm either.",negative

B0007E8TUM,"The first and the last: The rise and fall of the German fighter forces, 1938-1945 (Ballantine)",4.0,The WWII European Air War from a German Perspective: Allied-Precision-Bombing-Praise Irony,"Instead of repeating other reviewers, I mostly focus on undeveloped content. (Review is based on the 1954 edition). Adolf Galland's actions in the 1939 German/Soviet--Polish war are mentioned in the Publisher's Note. (p. ix). Oddly enough, Galland does not discuss it. Why? Also, both the Publisher (p. ix) and Galland (p. 17) repeat the myth of the Polish Air Force destroyed largely on the ground, a canard refuted not only by Allied but also by German sources. Click onThe Luftwaffe War Diaries: The German Air Force in World War II (Reprint), and read the Peczkis review. Galland does mention the Poles' 1944 Warsaw Uprising, and how the Soviets had betrayed it. (p. 301).The author provides much detail on the Battle of Britain. He speculates on the outcome of the Battle had it begun in the spring of 1940 instead of the summer, giving the Luftwaffe more time to destroy the R.A.F. before winter set in. He also asserts that Germany could have produced many more planes, up to that time, than she actually did according to wrong German priorities. Finally, he complains of the mistakenly-made short range of the German planes, which meant, according to him, that only 1/10th of England was subject to Luftwaffe combat, while 9/10ths of England had the luxury of unmolested aircraft manufacture, training of pilots, etc. [Is Galland exaggerating? I have seen maps that show roughly the eastern half of England within range of German planes. Furthermore, most British industry was located in the eastern and southern part of the British Isles.].Should fighter aircraft be allowed to shoot those who bale out of stricken planes? This question was discussed by Galland and Goering, with an ambiguous answer that balanced old-fashioned WWI air-war chivalry against the greater value of pilots over aircraft. (pp. 86-87). [In another context, Galland accused Polish pilots of shooting at German parachutists during the Battle of Britain, conveniently disregarding the fact that the Luftwaffe shot at Polish parachutists (not to mention columns of unarmed civilians) during the 1939 war.]Luftwaffe ace Werner Moelders is described as one who had strong religious convictions, and one who opposed the anti-Catholic polemics of the Nazi Party. However, Galland rejects the claim that this caused problems for Moelders or led to his violent death. (pp. 96-97).The British de Havilland Mosquito is described as an amazing plane that flew so high and was so fast that the German aircraft could not pursue it (except by diving) until they developed the ME-262 jet fighter plane. (p. 195-196). Also, its wooden construction gave it a faint signal on radar, making it an early form of stealth technology [using modern parlance, not Galland's].As for the ME-262 jet fighter, Galland contends that the Germans were 18 months ahead of the Allies in jet fighter technology. However, he realizes the fact that this technology was one that matured independently in different nations, not one nation alone. (p. 324).Throughout this work, Galland points to isolated successes of Allied precision bombing (e. g., the dam-busting raid), and uses these to argue for the ""uselessness"" of Allied carpet bombing. However, he refutes his own arguments when he elaborates on how easy it was for the Germans to protect their vital industry from precision Allied bombing: ""So far it [German war production] had been concentrated in 27 larger works arranged on production, technical and economic lines. Now it was spread over 729 medium and very small plants. Some were situated in tunnels, caves, or disused mines, some were hidden in forests, ravines, and villages. They were admirably camouflaged and not only made air observation difficult for the Allies but also their spying and sabotage."" (p. 305).",positive
B0007E8TUM,"The first and the last: The rise and fall of the German fighter forces, 1938-1945 (Ballantine)",5.0,Well-Read!,"The only one who could tell the story of Germany's Air Force in WW2 in such detail is someone who had fought alongside them, and that happens to be General Adolf Galland, who was there since the beginning and becoming an ace of over 70 air-to-air kills, and one of the few who managed to see the air force crash and burn in the last months of 1945. Without fuel or enough pilots, it mattered little that Germany's production of aircraft was far superior than the Allies with their first fighter jets, as it was done too little too late. Galland is a great author, as well as a splendid fighter, who managed to survive up to the end, unlike many of his comrades.The arrival of this book was met with great anticipation. The book is an original copy printed almost 50 years ago and the pages have colored with age, but I am impressed at the shape of the book, which is still in excellent condition after all these decades, and I'm glad that a book of this kind has been given a proper home and is read with great anticipation and also respect for it's delicate age.

0911572155,Secrets of Piano Construction - [ISBN 0 911572 15 5],4.0,AN ARCHITECTS' REFERENCE THAT WILL DELIGHT ANY THEATRE BUFF!,"Messrs. Seaxton and Betts, editors of the AMERICAN ARCHITECT magazine in 1927-30, compiled this originally two volume display of photographs, drawings, plans, and renderings of some 100 then new theatres. It is a somewhat technical gallery of how architects met the challenge of designing theatres for the multiple use concept then becoming commonplace, but its multitude of photos will delight anyone interested in the physical nature of theatres. This one-volume reprint contains an added Index to the theatres therein, but the non-glossy paper is not as faithful to the photos as is the glossy paper of the first edition, still to be seen in some libraries. Still, the first edition is absolutely unobtainable, and this edition is more than adequate! The 342 pages of this handsome hardbound book should please anyone who loves beautiful theatres as well as the somewhat technically oriented text. There are, of course, a few typos such as the caption being wrong for the lower left photo on page 58 of &quot;book 1&quot; (section) which is identified correctly on page 15, and the photo on page 28 of &quot;book 2&quot; (section) is really the MIDLAND THEATER, Kansas City, MO. The accuracy of these and other details can be verified by the Theatre Historical Soc. of America in Elmhurst, IL. Especially for would-be architects, this will take one into a dreamland of fantastic architecture which is now seeing some of the theatres pictured herein restored to usefulness, and this volume will generate a longing for the delightful aura of lavish (and not so lavish) movie palaces and theatres from the recent past. Had color photos been available at that time, this book would deserve 5 stars! This volume's worthy successor is the title: &quot;BEST REMAINING SEATS: The Story of the Golden Age of the Movie Palace&quot; (1961), or its later reprint edition: &quot;The Best Remaining Seats: The Golden Age of the Movie Palace&quot;(1987), both available here at Amazon.com.

0964170663,Erie Canal Legacy: Architectural Treasures of the Empire State,5.0,Beautifully photographs and accompanying written details,"Erie Canal Legacy ISBN: 0964170663, The Landmark Society of Western New York, byAndy Olenick and Richard O. Reisem is a coffee table book of remarkable beauty and a font of knowledge.New York State's Grand or Erie Canal extended 363 miles from the Hudson River in the east to Lake Erie in the west requiring a series of locks along the way to accommodate the changes in elevation. It was an architectural gem and marvel of engineering that required development of several unique techniques. The opening of the canal in 1825 is credited with extending the settlement and industrialization of the country beyond the Mississippi and thus nullifying the northward spread of the southern slavery influence that may well have changed the outcome of the Civil War.Interestingly enough, one can still navigate parts of this canal as part of a more extensive journey. As a pastime, I had completed training, and acquired, USCG Captain's and Master's papers and my wife had graduated from Marine Engineering School. So, we had decided to navigate ""The Big Wheel"". In April of 1989 we left St. Petersburg, Fl and traveled across the state, up the coast, in and out of the Intracoastal Waterway, through New York State to Lake Erie, Huron, and Michigan, down the Chicago River to the Mississippi, Ohio, Kentucky Lakes, Tennessee, the Tombigbee and across the Gulf back to St Petersburg. The passage through New York State was particularly interesting because of the condition of what remains of the canal for boaters' use. A few notes from my Log may provide material of interest: ""Undocked 0855 from Schenectady Y.C. (actually just a name-no club except probably for locals). Docked at canal terminal in Canajoharie 1545. Very difficult - wind blowing us off the dock which have no above water cleats or other for attachment except very widely spaced bollards - finally managed with help from a man on shore."" ""Usually only one cleat to attach both forward and aft lines when traversing the locks - difficult, at best for any vessel over thirty feet."" ""Great amount of missing information and misinformation - necessary to remove radar tower repeatedly after damage because of incorrect height furnished for bridges.""The navigable route today goes from Tarrytown to Schenectady, Canajoharie, Rome, across Oneida Lake, Brewerton, Lyons, North Greece, Tonawanda and into Lake Erie, and for one interesting section you are boating on a section of water looking down on the surrounding houses and farmland.In summary, the Erie Canal still is an interesting ride although a prospective boater must be aware of sometimes primitive conditions and, as mentioned, a goodly amount of erroneous information. With respect to the book, Erie Canal Legacy, Andy Olenik has provided awesome pictures of both the local architecture and gorgeous scenery and Richard O. Reisem has provided most interesting and relevant supportive narrative.",positive

The detective intuits his way through virtually every difficulty, using his mind reading powers to solve each problem.

0151813930,"The Stronger Women Get, the More Men Love Football: Sexism and the American Culture of Sports",5.0,"Well written, entertaining -- and scary","I'm a woman who has been puzzled and bemused for a long time by the male fixation on sports. How can a man remember the batting averages of all the players in last year's World Series, but not know the shoe size of the woman he's been married to for 10 years? Why does a man buy a newspaper, read every word of the sports section, and throw away the rest without even glancing at it? Why is a professional basketball player paid a salary that rivals (and often exceeds) that of the CEO of a major corporation, who is responsible for managing a trillion-dollar budget and thousands of employees? And why, when a local writer received a major national award, was she relegated to a few column-inches in the Local section of the paper, while the firing of a high school football coach made the front-page headlines?Nelson's book confirmed what I'd long suspected: as women have gradually broken through one glass ceiling after another, men have retreated into sports as the last bastion of traditional masculinity. It's a world in which &quot;girl&quot; is used as an insult, where men are permitted to express their affection only by punching each other, and where the only females allowed on the premises are decorative servants. But for those who claim that this is harmless male bonding and dismiss its critics as man-haters, Nelson shows the darker side: high school athletes who rape with impunity, glorification of mindless violence, and perpetuation of a concept of &quot;masculinity&quot; defined by behavior that would make a Neanderthal blush.While it's possible to pick holes in some of her arguments (I know female sports fans who are as ardently partisan as any man), I think Nelson's analysis is generally well done and convincing. My only criticism is that I would have appreciated more suggestions on &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot; But I think awareness of the problem is more than half the battle, and she's certainly done an excellent job of that!

Athletes of the ""manly"" sports continue to commit crimes out of all proportion to their representation in the population at large, and continue to get away with them. Their victims, most often of assault and rape, continue to be pilloried. Fans, coaches, parents, and officials continue to ignore or belittle these crimes and their consequences. Alcohol-fueled, testosterone-driven behavior at college parties is still the norm, locker room codes of silence still hold, the wink-wink nudge-nudge tolerance of ""boys will be boys"" is still accepted.And those of us who've grown hoarse pointing it out keep plugging away.Read this book for a comprehensive overview of the American culture of sports and the belligerence it breeds.

In addition, the author underestimates the strength of women, and discounts the possibility that being viewed as a sex object can be both stimulating and empowering to them. Her depiction of cheerleaders and topless dancers, among other things, were very shallow.

The colors and poses are at once traditional and postmodern, drawing as much on the thangka as the comic book.

0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),3.0,"Yeah, it's for English class.","The year is 1939, and Jick McCaskill is the most charming fourteen year old man of the land in Montana. At this tender age, he is just beginning to discover who he is and what he wants out of life. Ivan Doig paints a truly heartwarming picture of a young Montana boy's journey through adolescence in this poignant story about life in the country. The colorful characters are certain to remind you of your own friends and family, and Jick's boyish whims will bring you back to the joys and hardships of growing up. The quirky, humorous comparisons and tart cynicsms also contribute to the allure of the novel. However, this book is not for those with short attention spans. Doig uses beautiful , graceful language to describe the Two Medicine Country of Montana over and over and over again, and it begins to seem redundant. The general flow of the story is slow and steady with no real change in pace. This book will be a relaxing read if nothing else, and the recurring motif of the past helps to maintain a nostalgic tone throughout. This tale of turning points will carry you through family strife, natural disasters, and the resolving of age old grudges on the shoulders of Jick McCaskill. You will relive (or experience) the advancement frok grape soda to whiskey, and remember what its like to stand up to a family member for the first time. It will remind you to cherish the past, but live in the present, and make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, as long as you stay awake long enough to get through it.",neutral
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),2.0,Very Dull,I had to read this book for my college english class and it may in fact be the most boring book I have ever read. I am an avid reader and usually will read anything that I can get my hands on but I couldn't wait to end this stupid book and get on with my life. Every single one of my classmates hated it and unless you're a very cruel english teacher please don't make your poor students read this god forsaken book. I only gave it two stars because the last two pages were the only interesting ones out of the VERY long drawn out book!,negative
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),5.0,Simply magical!,"Doig's characters are just incredible. His sense of humor is immense. His description of the depression years in Montana is fascinating. And of course, the landscapes inspired by his acquaintance with the countryside depicted in ENGLISH CREEK are breathtaking. This is the best book I have read in ages! I am going to find a way to work it into my American literature course, because it is not only a great book, it's a priceless piece of Americana.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),5.0,An all-time favorite,"I uncovered Doig's ""Dancing at the Rascal Fair"" at a small bookstore in Oregon many years ago. Since then, his books have earned a ""do not loan"" status on my bookshelf. I'll tell friends how much I love his books, but they have to buy their own copies. English Creek is one of my favorites. It immersed me in Montana, in a young boy's summer, in the fold of time between childhood and adulthood. While some of Doig's books have a darker, gritty, edge, English Creek made me laugh outloud. I've just ordered three more copies to give as gifts to friends who I know will love the premise, the prose and the portrait of life on the edge of growing up.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),3.0,Good Bildungsroman,"This is a very good coming of age novel - historical novel. Set in rural Montana on the eve of World War II, English Creek describes the summer experiences of an intelligent 15 year old. Written by a Montana native who has done a good deal of historical research, English Creek is not only a Bildungsroman but also a detailed portrait of life in rural Montana. Told with humor and considerable insight, English Creek is a sweet but not saccharine book about a more innocent but not necessarily easier time.",neutral
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),5.0,Doig writes books as real as life itself,"ENGLISH CREEK is about a boy's awakening into maturity. It's the summer of his 15th birthday and Jick McCaskill experiences new awareness -- of his history as well as of his relationships with and among family and friends. His sense of security is threatened when his older brother defies their parents to take up with a local beauty and become a cowboy instead of going to college. Jick is challenged by unexpected changes in new grown-up ways and as he meets those challenges he sees himself and his world through a dying innocence.To say Doig's prose is rich and powerful is like describing a tornado as breezy. A master of the English language, story-teller par excellence and character builder supreme, funny, intelligent, witty, sad is to understate. Superlatives fall short of accuracy. Ivan Doig's books are as real as life itself. To contemplate his words is to rethink reality and to embrace new insights.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),4.0,"Characters, descriptive language, and style!","A reviewer of Mr. Doig's &quot;English Creek&quot; notes that it does not deal with a &quot;dysfunctional family&quot;. The other current fad the author avoids is the emphasis on &quot;quirkiness&quot; vs. character. Like Wallace Stegner and David Guterson, Mr. Doig's feeling for the land is aparent in his careful and lovely descriptions. Most of all, he presents us with characters so well developed and described we feel we know them. This emphasis on believable characters is, in my estimation, the strongest point of &quot;Dancing at the Rascal Fair&quot; and &quot;English Creek&quot;. I enjoyed both tremendously and look froward to finishing the Montana trilogy.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),4.0,Top-notch storytelling,"Like the other novels of Ivan Doig that I have read, ENGLISH CREEK might fall shy of great literature, but it certainly is top-notch storytelling. Doig's narrator for this story is Jick McCaskill, who has as personable a narrative style as one could want. Looking back over more than a quarter century, Jick tells the story of his summer of 1939, when he was 14 and grew from boy to young man. His story moves along at a leisurely pace, but it never stalls, largely because of the wry humor and charm of both his narration and many of his characters. And in telling the story, Jick/Doig give us what I am confident is a realistic picture of ranching life in Northwest Montana, at the foot-hills of the Rockies as they rise out of the plains, just before WWII. Particularly vivid and memorable are extended set pieces of a community Fourth of July (with picnic, rodeo, and square dance), end-of-summer haying, and fighting a raging forest fire.It may well be that the book will appeal most to readers ""of a certain age,"" as they say. I am uncertain what the cut-off is (about 45?), but for those who have passed the threshold I have little doubt that they will enjoy the story immensely.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),4.0,Great literature,"This is a fabulous book. The writing is not focused on action and plot, but on character and setting. Doig creates a vivid Montana scene while leading his main character, Jick, through a book paced exactly as his summer. If you are looking for good literature, read this book.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),4.0,"I loved the style, but not the ending.","Doig's writing, like so many who are from Montana and write about it, captures nature beautifully. Like other writers from this area (Norm McClean comes to mind) Doig paints a beautiful picture of plains, mountains, and of course the weather becomes a character in itself. My only disappointment was the denouement in the end. It rather strained the credibility of an otherwise realistic story. I would rather Doig had stayed away from actually telling a story, and had made it more a novel &quot;about nothing.&quot; For this reason, I enjoyed &quot;This House of Sky&quot; more, but this is still a novel which I feel falls into the class of literature, rather than popular fiction. For me, that is high praise indeed.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),5.0,If Only World Enough &amp; Time,"Doig details the life of the 14-year-old Jick in Two Medicine Country. This is a subtle, slice of life book that in the end will split your heart like a close knit family suddenly breaking apart. The images of the people of Two Medicine Country, the dance scene, and the relationship of Jick with his older brother fall into your mind like your own memories. This is the masterpiece by one of this century's best.",positive
0140084428,English Creek (Contemporary American Fiction),4.0,"A Bit Pokey, But Delightful For Patient Readers","From forest fires to sheep counts, haying season to a whizbang Fourth of July celebration, Jick McCaskill moves through the summer of 1939 in Montana's Two Medicine country. For Jick it's ""The Summer When..."" He begins noticing a lot of things, including the fact that ""time is the trickiest damn commodity,"" and he won't be a boy for very much longer.Full of charm and drollery, English Creek is not for the easily bored, but it's worth the patience if you want to see how an author can sometimes make the language get up and dance. The characters are vivid and the vernacular sublime. Some of the one-liners might make you wish you had occasion to recycle them.My favorite line comes when one guy goes up on a rock outcropping to relieve himself and Jick's father says, ""I hope you've got a good foothold up there. Because you sure don't have all that much of a handhold."" (Ouch!)If you find this book too slow moving but you want a taste of Doig's magic, pick up The Whistling Season. It's a masterpiece of storytelling.",positive

I found it extremely helpful in driving my son and brother all over Scotland. We were able to see most all of the sites we desired and a few that were complete and wonderful surprises. The only reason we couldn't see everything was because of lack of time.I am the &quot;Queen of Lost While Driving,&quot; and even I could find my way with this guide. It tells you what landmarks to look for, snipets of the history of where you are on the road, and the traditions of the people in the area in which you are driving.It gives you a practical guide of information in the back and a timetable for each driving tour. The wonderful thing about this book is that you may follow their time plan or invent your own. Every time we strayed from the outlined tour for an impromptu journey, it was very easy to get back on course. In addition, it's much easier and less bulky than having a huge open road map in the front seat of one of those dinky cars they drive over there.Again, if you want to travel in Scotland with relative freedom and confidence, take along &quot;Scotland's Best-Loved Driving Tours.&quot;",positive

The color photos helped us narrow down our choices to a reasonable number of drives. They show the terrain and some of the sights on each tour, so you can pick several different ones that offer unique views and places to see.If you are planning on renting a car and driving in Scotland, I would suggest combining this book with a full Scotland or Britain guidebook like &quot;Let's Go.&quot; You will need full listings of places to stay, admission costs to castles and sights, and historical information about the area.

It seems that the original audience for this book is the AA, Automobile Assn (in the US, AAA) members looking for vacations or day trips. Although the book gives 25 great routes to take for scenery, it does not spend very much space telling you about what it is you are seeing when you get there, assuming you already know the history of the castle and so forth.This book could be very helpful if you were going to be in country for a couple of weeks or months, then coupled with more informative, detail oriented guides, this could lead you to some wonderful vistas.

One will have plenty of driving tours and routes to chose from, whether you like arts and museums, scenic roads and breathtaking views, urban towns and shopping, or just want to experience a regione's culture and life.Unlike the other Frommer guides that are fatter and heavier, this little book gives you not too many specifics on lodging or eating. It is geared strictly for the person behind the wheel and her or his passengers.I have had a great experience using this guide and will recommend it to anyone who can afford it. Also, you might want to check to see if your library carries it and check it out for the duration of your visit abroad.When I backpacked 4 months through Europe I had a copy of the Lonely Planet for Europe (a thick and heavy book) because it covered more cities and esoteric towns, a ripped chapters of all the international youth hostals Europe of the countries I visited, and as primary guide for nominal cities and capitals I used Frommers (ripped the book and kept only chapters of countries planning to visit - so I can keep the weight down).",positive

So what I had to do on my own was to cobble together pieces of various stops out of the book to fit my planned itinerary and choice of hotel stops. Since I bought the Historic Scotland Pass I also tended to visit those sites more than others in the guide. These factors made this book more of a resource picking places to visit along the way than anything else. A future edition would benefit by including about three good circle routes around Scotland (beginning at one of the two major airport cities: Glasgow or Edinburgh) to help plan a one or a two week long vacation.",positive

If you're into refined (ie action-free and romantic) plots (poetry, music, love, illness, sacrifice, and death), you'll laugh (plenty of comedy at the beginning) and (later) cry your eyes out watching this DVD, thanks in chief to the superb performances of Anita Raj and Raj Babbar as the handsome tragic couple. Due to the brilliant dialogues, lyrics, and music, the film (which I wish were longer) never drags. Recommended without any reservations.

013143344X,The Need to Kill: Inside the World of the Serial Killer,5.0,What A Book - Full of Insight on Serial Killers,"I had heard many myths about serial killers. I have seen the movies. I've read the books.Serial killers have had horrific upbringing. They have been abused mentally, physically, and mentally. They have tortured little animals. These bad people and mutants from hell but the problem is that they fit in and could be your next door neighbor Bob. He could have a woman in his basement hooked up to wires to shock her every ten minutes while he is outside on a sunny day drinking a beer while he washes his car and talks baseball with you (go Boston go!). You never know. It could be Bob, Dave, Ted, Harold, Greg, Cary, Pat, Jeff, Pedro or any male name. (usually not a Debbi, Ann, Sue, Kathy, Mary)They have an uncanny ability to elude the police while committing their vile acts. They prey on people they find attractive and weak who cross their path. They're not like us, well, maybe some of you. (if you are a serial killer please email me).In The Need to Kill, the author is one of the field's leading researchers tells you who the serial killers and really are by name, location, and if they are currently active or inactive. This will allow you to stay away from any serial killers in your neighborhood. This book frightening me and made me scared and shake. I couldn't sleep. I won't even go outside to wash my car anymore.The doctor draws pictures and 20+ years' of research-including experience as a homicide investigator (not an instigator). He provides clarity and hope to keep us away from these crazy serial killers.Profiles are included of John Wayne Gacy (poor clown), Ted Bundy (bad teeth - his downfall), Henry Lee Lucas (not the Star Wars guy), me and Jeffrey Dahmer (eater of flesh...human flesh, now dead, someone ate him in prison). You'll go into the serial killers mind and body and you won't like it but you must.You will be terrifying and really really scarededed. The Need to Kill is the one book that truly illuminates the mind of these bad bad people. Bad people. REDRUM over and over again. Kill, kill, kill, they should get a hobby.

The argument has been made that the information contained in this book is stuff that men should already know and that it is common sense. Perhaps it is, but most men (or maybe just me) do not come ready made with the knowledge of what it takes to plan a wedding or how to best be helpful in that process. This book is for the average guy who wants to be able to help (rather than hinder) the planning of his wedding.This book has detail about each part of the planning process (from engagement through honeymoon) and lets the guy know what he needs to do, what he should do, and where he should step out of the way. This book has a bit more detail in some places than the more entertaining (though equally informative) book ""The Clueless Groom's Guide"", so I would consider this one (as well as the previously mentioned book) to be essential groom's guides and invaluable to the average guy who only knows that he should be standing up at the alter waiting for his wife to be to walk down the aisle.

Secondly, it provides a great sense of focus, that can help make the wedding planning a lot less confusing. While planning it is easy to forget everything you need to do (even if you knew it months before), and sometimes it can help one remember the real meaning of the wedding. And lastly, for those guys who have to mediate anything between their bride and/or their families, this book provides a great reference for telling &quot;Dad&quot; that, in fact, he does have to pay for the ladies' corsages, or the bride that, despite her feelings to the contrary, that she might be spending a bit much on the cake.

1414220278,The Mirror of the Sea,5.0,Escapism,"When Conrad was struggling with the writing of big fat novels like Nostromo or Razumov (Under Western Eyes), he was suffering. Writing was torture. He needed an escape mechanism, and he also needed money. This edition unites the 2 products of that double motive. The first is a collection of essays about the sea, the second a short autobiographic walkabout.I like A Personal Record a lot better than The Mirror of the Sea.With Conrad, fiction beats non-fiction.An amazon friend's review of a Gide essay collection recently was entitled `non fiction beats fiction'. (Gide was Conrad's French friend in the literary world.)My opinion on Conrad is: while Gide's fiction may have sunk with time, and his essays may still be floating, with Conrad it is the other way round. His sea fiction has enormous buoyancy, while his essays have a certain leaden quality.During his struggle with Nostromo, in 1904/5, Conrad wrote, on the side, and by dictation at night (I am wondering about the opportunities involved in that), a series of sketches of autobiographical nature. They were all published separately in newspapers and magazines, and then collectively as The Mirror of the Sea.The book was a critical success, but it has been shown that it was unreliable as a biographical source. Conrad made things up and misrepresented facts. Which proves my point, he was a fiction writer.The book is a lament of the lost culture of the sailing ship, and at the same time of a closed chapter of his own life. He had quit the sea for the life of a writer on land, and it was a hard life, the writing.JC says in his own introduction: I have attempted here to lay bare ... the terms of my relation with the sea. ... for twenty years I have lived like a hermit with my passion! ...Within these pages I make a full confession not of my sins but of my emotions.So, he goes and writes, at times entertainingly, about landfalls and departures, anchors and wrong language (casting!), drinking captains and presumptuous mates, storms, pleasure sailing, the ethics of craftsmanship, ships in calamity (overdue, missing, stranded, lost), the near mystic relation between man and ship (a she!), between man and nature, about river estuaries, ports, docks, about Nelson and Trafalgar and about some stories from his youth... This is an easy process for Conrad, compared to the hard labor of his fiction. The writing did not require his usual meticulous composition; the voice is that of a TV documentary host. The texts are assembled without subtitles, and in a sequence which is different from the publishing chronology.Is it worth it? For me and for other members of the fan club, sure. For aficionados of the subject, i.e. ships and the sea, certainly. For others, hardly.Now the Personal Record is another matter entirely. JC wrote it for his soon to be former friend F.M.Ford, who wanted to start a new magazine and publish literary autobiographies. JC's text focuses mainly on two subjects: his escape from Poland for the sea, which meant moving to the West, and his escape from the sea for writing as a living. Interestingly, he denies explicitly that the question why he chose to write in English is a legitimate question at all. After all, what else could he have done?We follow different episodes involving the growth of Almayer's Folly, his first novel. We follow JC on a visit to Poland to his relatives and hear a lot about the family history back to Napoleon and about the uncle, who had adopted JC when his parents had died.Why did he `run away' to the sea after all? He was a reader from childhood on. He likens his escape to the exodus of Don Qijote from his village in La Mancha: the romance of adventure.Now, honestly, does that amount to a `Personal Record'? Critics at the time were annoyed. Not only was the text absolutely no record of anything, rather a rambling discourse which jumps through chronos like we love it from Conrad's fiction. Well, some of us do. I do.Conrad anticipated some opposition. He quotes Marcus Aurelius asking for heroic truth. He makes a categorical statement: JC's truth is more of the humble kind.And anyway, another quote, now from Novalis (not so beloved by me): I will believe myself as soon as I find somebody else who believes me. (Maybe that's less a quote than a free interpretation.)As I said, Conrad was great at fiction, his fiction beats his non-fiction hands down. Lucky for us, he was no fanatic of bare facts.",positive

It is unusual in that it is one of the first book that I have come across that puts forth a reason for the significance of ERP's like SAP and a framework for its relevance. The book is worth for this alone! If you are planning for a SAP implementation, you should look this book up, this book explians in detail many issues that occur in a SAP implementation. It also provides the best introduction to SAP R/3 that I have seen, including the features and functionalities of SAP Functional Modules, ABAP and Basis.I have rated this book high because this is also the only book that provides details of SAP's AcceleratedSAP (ASAP) implementation methodology for mid-sized companies. There is more! It also has good introduction to the latest SAP offerings like SAP BW, ALE, SEM, SCM, mySAP.com and many others. In the last chapter it talks about issues beyond the enterprise/ internet etc. that are being addressed by SAP.The book is well written and quite comprehensive on subjects covered --- I did find a few typos though.

I was not disappointed. The Creative Curriculum is a guide for early childhood classrooms which addresses the environment and learning centers, as well as the role of the teacher. It is compatible with other known practices in early childhood, including the project approach, Reggio Emilia, and emergent curriculum. The book describes the setup and rationale for learning centers from Blocks to Library to outdoors. There are letters and information for parents, assessment and documentation sections.

1879537435,"The Creative Curriculum for Preschool, 4th edition",5.0,wholisitc look and approach to Early Childhood Ed,"This curriculum book manages to cram as much information into its 530 pages as possible. It starts with an overview of child development in chapter one, entitled ""How Children Deveop and Learn"". Chapter one also introduces and explains what I consider the most exciting aspect of the Creative Curriculum program- the developmental continuum as a tool for tracking children's progress and identifying areas for the program to focus attention. The continuum states a program goal, let's say ""knowledge of the alphabet"" and then proceeds to state specific examples to help teachers assess how far a child has acheived in meeting that goal, ranging from forerunner skills (child points out that there are letters on their cubby and those letters mean this is the child's cubby) and listing 2 more examples of growing understanding, then ending with a high (for preschool) level of understanding (makes sound-letter connections and demonstrates it by writing a D on a picture they state they want to give to dad). The Creative Curriculum continuum has 50 stated goals coverng all domains of development. I find this tool extremely helpful in general program planning, individualization to meet specific needs of a specific child, and in communicating with parents.The book also has informative chapters regarding setting up the classroom environment and the family-school partnership. This book continues with a chapter on each learning center typically found in an ECE classroom such as the book corner, blocks, and water table. It states items found in that area with suggestions on how to use them and highligting what content areas (literacy, math skills, social skills, etc.)are addressed. The other thing I am also particularly pleased with this book is how it repeatedly reinforces how Early Childhood Educators assist children in furthering their understanding through teacher-child discussions,teacher modeling, and posing open questions such as ""I wonder what will happen if you...?"" Children are not just left to their own devises in a ""safe and interesting environment."" The majority of learning occurs with people interacting with each other.I even find the planning forms helpful, and I usually prefer to make up my own things like that.Overall, a comprehensive and developmentally appropriate approach to teaching small children. Highly Recommended.",positive

Granted that the Bible isn't Holy Ground, but rather battleground, it is wonderful to see what Joseph Smith has don with the Bible to improve it. He understood that doing a new translation of the Bible was a branch of his calling (HC 1:238, D&C; 107:92)I think that every great churchman has his own version of the Cannon. The Jews believe in the Hebrew Scriptures, the Catholics believe in the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures along with the Apocrypha. Martin Luther removed the Apocrypha, and classified the Book of James as an ""epistle of straw, and frowned upon the Book of Revelation. Thomas Jefferson also had his Unitarian version of the Bible, with his vi3ew of the scriptures. More recently, Dr. James MacArthur came out with his rather intense version of the Bible, with many footnotes and maps.What Joseph Smith did was to pray over the Bible and receive inspiration about what needed to be corrected and restored back to the Bible. The version clears up some of the contradictions and questions of the Bible, such as Cain's wife, the length of days of creation, what God was doing before the creation, and weather or not Moses actually wrote the first five books.This edition differs slightly from the official Community of Christ (RLDS) version of the bible since it includes the preface to the book of Genesis that they Community of Christ places as a section in their Doctrine and Covenants. This book follows the Community of Christ versification and punctuation. There are no footnotes. ""Songs of Solomon"" is missing without any explanation. The Joseph Smith Translation manuscript mentions that the Song of Solomon was not inspired. The footnote to Hebrews 5:8 explaining that the parenthetic refers to Melchizedek and not Christ is also missing.We do not have a perfect version of the Joseph Smith Translation, but this edition helps us come close to the goal.",positive

It would be too easy to slam this trash...but, the Mormon church obviously agree with me. Actions from the printing press in Salt Lake speak louder than Joe's revision. If Joe's updated version of God's word was really INSPIRED why would the Mormons still continue to print by the millions the UNINSPIRED king James version instead?...and why would Joe's version be sooo hard to get? out of print????? duhhhh. I urge anyone not under the spell of Joe and the Mormons to watch this video on the Book of Abraham...another Harlequin novel from the master of pulp.

B0007IT632,Ricci-Calculus: An Introduction to Tensor Analysis and Its Geometrical Applications,5.0,"Review of ""Ricci Calculus""","""Ricci Calculus"" is the defacto standard reference for tensor transformation theory. Schouten (pronounced ""Scoutin"") introduces fundamental geometric quantities based on the co-and contravariant transformation rules and then systematically builds up a manifold based on invariance of these quantities. The various geometric manifolds are constructed in a systematic way, starting from rectilinear coordinates and then by introduction of the ""metric,"" connection, curvature tensors, and so forth. The book initially appears terse but once you get the hang of it and really stick with it, the power of the notation emerges and the notation also functions as an efficient book-keeping device when doing transformation theory calculations. Often, the meaning of certain calculations are even clarified when following Schouten's approach. Although specific applications are not really discussed in this work, the book is a must-have reference for those applying tensor transformation theory in general relativity, gauge fields, continuum theory, and complex manifolds.",positive

It regained popularity when the animated features on Playhouse Disney began rolling this June. Both the book and TV versions show Shanna, with large, expressive eyes and plenty of sass. Little brother Shane (same name as the illustrator, by the way) and stuffed critters Dinah-saurus, Ducky, and Tiger complete the quirky ensemble cast. Each story is told in catchy rhyming verse printed both in bold, easy-to-read font and speech balloons (like in comic strips). The book gives 5 clues, the TV show only 3. I like the problem solving skills it develops as it challenges readers to figure out what Shanna's occupation could be - a princess, ballerina, teacher, or doctor. The story also encourages creativity. My girls, ages 4.5 and 2.5, are often inspired to put on their own shows.",positive

0793527155,Eric Clapton - From the Album Eric Clapton Unplugged,3.0,good for easy guitar,"Naturally, the title tells it all. Well, not naturally, but in this case it just so happens to be so. Although, as you can tell, I gave it 3 stars, it really can be made 5 stars if you're for the most part a beginner. The book includes all of the unplugged songs, and they are even in TAB form. The only catch is that these TAB's aren't the actual TAB's Clapton plays. Thus, although you'll be playing a more complex version of the songs then just chords, it still won't have the same fingering as Claptons. Although there is another version that actually has the exact fingering as Clapton (besides the solos, unfortunately), I haven't seen it on Amazon. There is one more version of the book on Amazon, but I'm pretty sure that it is the chords only verison, or sheet music version. Personally speeking, I've only played for around 1 1/2 years, and I have found the real version (the one with Claptons actual fingering in TAB form, which isn't available on Amazon) to be rather easy, and rewarding. Although some songs you might just rather learn the chords for, others loose much of thier style when played in only chords. Thus, I recommend going down to your local Guitar Center and seeing if they have the real version in stock. As far as the content, it's what you expect from slowhand. Perfection. The album consists of many blues classics, and the book is true to it. In my opinion, nearly every song on this album is worth knowing how to play if you wish to enhance your mastery of the blues.

These are difficult songs and to sound anything like the song on the album, you're going to have to put in a LOT of time and practice. If you can learn a bar or two at a time, and have a song mastered in several months, you're doing good. Treat this as a project for a year and you'll feel a lot less frustration. I've been playing for 50 years and these songs are still a challenge to get perfect.5. Clapton doesn't always finger his chords/notes the same way. Sometimes he uses the thumb-over on the 6th string for the bass notes, sometimes not. He'll also play differently depending on who he is playing with. So don't compare the book to a YouTube video of Clapton. It's his right to play his own song anyway he feels like it on any particular occasion.",positive

I write that statement because when one see's the video (EC Uplugged) in slow motion you can see EC playing slightly different cords. In addition, if one is looking at different website's for guitar tab in reference to the songs on the EC Unplugged you will see a spectrum of transcriptions to the songs.

0281056188,Logic of Renewal,5.0,Abraham Brings the Voices in for Renewal,"Abraham is not writing to the academic or the theologian who decides to stay in the depths of God, but to the Church where it is. His language is often forceful, especially when he wishes to disagree with one of his examinations (149; and his issues with changing `patriarchal language' for the sake of change). He is not biting, but provides his readers with enough to chew on. His presentation, at least in as far as it seems to one who has not read many of the works examined, seems fair, although he shows the true intellectual dogma of not believing, agreeing, or accepting out of hand everything present to him, and to him us. The author is careful to let the examinees speak for themselves, and had generally aligned the comparisons neatly so as to present two different views of renewal to contract one another immediately and directly (The easiest example of this is Cupitt and Norman as well as Wagner and Reno).Most importantly was Abraham's refusal to accept fully anything presented and to consistently, even if his personal agreements seemed to come through (such as with MLK, Newbigin and Wagner). Further, his discussion of the Enlightenment throughout the book is relevant because it is something that we still face today, either in faith or in reason. For myself, I prefer the side of reason; however, through the readings on Cupitt and Spong, there are errors in reason over the Spirit which I see need to be addressed not only in myself, but so too the larger Church. This is Abraham's most important contribution, in that Abraham readily secures against the full encroachment of the Enlightenment's brand of Reason, but challenges those, such as Draper, Norman and Wagner, to make use of intellectual integrity to propel the Church forward. Finally, Abraham, against Cupitt and others who wish to simply dismiss the `canonical' tools of the Church, instead insists on holding more firmly to them to guide us into renewal.While Abraham sees the renewal of the church heavily dependent upon the canons of the past (169), I would have preferred to see a chapter by him (although admittedly, his work on this subject most likely addresses it fully) directly on this subject. The Scriptural canon is something still held differently by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants, and among Protestants there are the debates involving translations, such as the King James Version only movement and the use of inclusive language. Further, there is the notion of original text, which as F.F. Bruce would point out, is a canonical question all of its own. Then, there are the Councils, of which Protestants hold to just a few, as well as the Creeds which many Protestants simply dismiss as unnecessary, or hold in vile and utter contempt. While I appreciate his allusions to these issues, I would rather have seen his stance detailed more than just a footnote to his previous work.The ministry aspect of this, I think, is that first and foremost, many voices are needed, but rarely do they have the singular answer to the question of Church Renewal. Instead, the voices contribute to the overall answer, although we may not see it at the moment. Further, we have to understand just what our experiences do to our viewpoint. Taking Spong as the primary example of this, I see that his background in fundamentalism shaped his need to run as far as possible from any foothold into literalism or Christian history. Because of this, Spong seems to want to remake Christianity into his own image, devoid of the Spirit, the Creeds, the Scripture, and most importantly, the miracles in which we find Christian reality. The same, although the origins are different, may be said of Cupitt; however, with people such as Dr. King, the background helps to shape in a positive way the vision cast for renewal. There is a danger then, of being too subjective in determining your path forward (such as Reno), although the opposite is true as well (Newbigin) in which one may have an almost dominionist control over Church and State. Ministry is always rooted in subjectivity, but sometimes, our answers for renewal need to go beyond our experiences and viewpoints.",positive

037388091X,Falling Out Of Bed (Harlequin Next),5.0,complex family drama,"Her father Stanley has always been a healthy workaholic horse until now. At seventy-two Stanley has cancer so his daughter Melinda, though in denial, brings him to live with her. Melinda who already quit her job as a schoolteacher since her spouse David has been successful plans to care for her ailing dad.David resents Melinda's attention given to Stanley and is upset that they never really spoke about this. Melinda's mother, divorced from Stanley, has mixed feelings about her ex's health. However Melinda and her dad forge a strong relationship and she begins to realize that you live only once so don't waste it snoozing, but the cost of her lesson could prove great.FALLING OUT OF BED is a complex family drama that focuses on the impact of a debilitating lethal illness on the prime caretaker and indirectly on others in her inner circle. Melinda struggles with seeing how helpless and hopeless her father has fallen while David feels guilt in spite of logically understanding why he still resents the attention his wife gives to his father-in-law. The other support cast members seem real as they, like Melinda and David, can get frustrated with Stanley. Yet interestingly with the struggles to decide what is right for everyone in a situation with no chance for win-win, this tale contains a brilliant underlying message of hope and faith that aging boomers will appreciate.Harriet Klausner",positive
B000N6QNJS,HEGEL,5.0,The greatest living philosopher,"After the death of both Deleuze and Levinas in 1995, the mantle of ""greatest living philosopher"" presumably went to Jacques Derrida for a while. But Derrida has always refused to be a philosopher other than in the sense of not being a philosopher (which is also being a philosopher). So his cohort and quasi-follower Jean-Luc Nancy had to take the real philosophy from Derrida back to the question underlying all post-modern thought, namely how to deal with the empty space left behind by Heidegger's deconstruction of the tradition. With this little book, Nancy himself has become ""the greatest living philosopher"" - that is to say he has done to Hegel what Heidegger did to Nietzsche in the 1930s and 1940s: presented him as the key thinker of the break of modernity, and, unnoticeably perhaps, stepped beyond him. This book is indeed a marvel - one gets slightly dizzy reading it. Its intensity is at times (no: always) well-nigh unbearable. Nancy, like Heidegger with Nietzsche, takes a drill to the concepts of Hegel and allows them to shine in ways hitherto unthought(see the editorial review above, no need to repeat the details). In the end, this is the overturning of the boring old French Hegel of Kojeve and Hyppolite and the most exciting discovery in philosophical reading of another in sixty some years. I had always thought of Hegel as the great synthesizer. But Nancy's Hegel ""returns"" Hegel to pre-Socratic instability and shaky difference, where the restless thought-in-process constitutes the sense of the world, and philosophy is as alive as it ever was. A friend of mine says that Nancy reminds him of the color of the LED on alarm clocks: well, he's right, 'cause Jean-Luc Nancy is very much a phenomenon of a new morning. The owl is disoriented but it is all a marvel. Yes, I guess that is what you could say.",positive
B000N6QNJS,HEGEL,5.0,An intro to Hegel for the 21st century,"Kojeve's ""Introduction to the Reading of Hegel"" is a great work of philosophical interpretation and a great aid to understanding Hegel, but the rendering of Hegel Nancy expresses here may now supersede Kojeve (writing mid-century) for grasping Hegel's relevance (if any) for us living at the dawn of the 21st century.This volume not only illuminates the intellectual roots of continentals such as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze in Hegel (rewardingly illuminating their own work in turn), but it provides a recapture of Hegel for the left from the neo-conservative right (who argued persuasively to power for the Iraq war on the basis of right-Hegelian thinking about Western history).Although the language can seem complex, steeped in the continental philosophical discourse as it is, the book can be a great aid to clarifying and bringing to life Hegel's speculative way of thinking (from the ""we"", even if a fragmented ""we"") for gaining social insights.For instance, in the chapter ""Becoming"", Nancy gives the simplest and yet most satisfying explanation of a particularly controversial moment in Hegel's thought -- the 'presupposition' of the absolute. The way Nancy explains this moment (with some aid from Heidegger it seems) helps greatly to understand how a misunderstanding of this philosophical move -- the 'naive' assumption that being here, ""hic et nunc"", is apiece of the absolute -- can lead to much confusion and difficulties in later moments of Hegel's argument.",positive
B000N6QNJS,HEGEL,5.0,yes you should read it,"Briefly, this book is Nancy at his best -- majestic and concise, operating across all registers. Over 75 pages, you'll find a summation of Nancy's own philosophy and ethics as much as an elucidation of what he finds in Hegel. (Turns out Hegel looks a lot like J-L.) The language is delicate but potent, transparent -- not the fancy footwork and disruptions of sense you get in some of his other stuff. The whole thing goes full blast, no holds barred. How things appear, how boundaries operate. How subjects come into contact with the world. The coordinates of philosophy. Freedom, truth, and finally community. A taught lyric in relation to the epics inspired by Hegelian thought (including the new Zizek, which comes to similar conclusions). Anyone interested in continental thought will find this a pleasure to read.",positive
0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,4.0,This is an important book for all ministers and counselors.,"Francis Macnutt has a long and credible history in the practice of healing prayer. His compassion and faith leads him to share what he knows with others. With many more praying, many many more are helped. His prayer style is calm and confident. It is the power of God and not the energy of hype that brings healing through his prayers and others. Through his instruction and the instruction of John Wimber and Charles Kraft, I too have seen people healed, by God, when I have prayed for them.This book specializes in deliverance from evil spirits, a topic that challenges our enlightened western minds. Many churches that preach the existence of Satan and demons, do not acknowledge that people need help and deliverance. Francis MacNutt's experience and the Biblical record lead to another conclusion. Demonic influence in varying degrees does affect many, and they need deliverance. Those who know this and take authority over the demonic realm can bring freedom to those who need it so desperately.This book will guide you through evidence for demonization, the types of demons that you might encounter, and practical instruction for dealing with them. Franics MacNutt tells us that demonization is different from what is popularly known as &quot;demon possession.&quot; Possession represents an extreme and rare form of demonization. Rather one or several demons may link themselves to a part of our lives. Often, they only manifest themselves when their territory is invaded by other forms of healing prayer.It is significant to note the care Francis MacNutt takes to distinguish between demonization and emotional wounds, and the very important difference between Multiple Personality Disorder and demonization. As in all his books, his methods involve a partnership between prayers of faith and modern medicine and counseling techniques.This is an important book, written in a professional style that maintains interest throughout. It was a great encouragement to me.",positive

Of course, the Holy Spirit is still the primary source of all &quot;how-to's&quot;, but the information MacNutt offers is invaluable. Also recommend Noel and Phyl Gibson's Evicting Demonic Intruders and Rebecca Brown's He Came to Set the Captives Free.

0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,4.0,Straitforward take on an weird topic,"As a person who values rationality, I would hardly be expected to add a book titled ""Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual"" to my must-read list. But when I ran across it in the bookstore, I felt oddly compelled to pick it up. Far from being loony, this book by Francis MacNutt (now there's a name for you!) has assembled a very straightforward account of his work delivering people from evil spirits.MacNutt takes seriously the talk of evil spirits in the New Testament. Unlike contemporary scholars who see demons as metaphoric or psychological in nature, MacNutt believes that Jesus Christ truly encountered and overcame dark spirits, and that part of his good news was that in him, the dominion of God had broken into the world to destroy a literal dominion of evil. This concept is simple and easy enough to accept. Though many mainline Christians call Jesus Savior and Reedemer, they often don't ask, ""Saved from what?"" and ""Redeemed from whom?"" MacNutt answers: ""Saved from bondage to evil"" and ""Redeemed from the Evil One."" Simple answers like these are attractive, and more accessible than reams of scholarly texts explaining away what the gospels present without hesitation.MacNutt believes that evil spirits exist, that they infest or possess certain people, and that Christians have the duty and obligation to pray for deliverance from these spirits. He also believes that many main-line clerics are reluctant to deal with the demonic, leaving many to suffer the predations of the Evil One. In calm, unnutty tones, MacNutt catalogues a variety of evil spirits, the types of demonic oppression and the power of curses.MacNutt's thesis is fascinating, and empowering if true. If real, we should learn to recognize evil, protect ourselves from it and rid ourselves of it. Not to say that he is completely convincing. Calling certain demons ""laziness "" or ""anger"" (...) comes pretty close to the psychologizing tendency of mainline churches. Some of his claims about the appearance of certain demons is silly. His depiction of a potbellied, top-hatted demon made me think he spent too much time in the voodoo shack. MacNutt also believes in ritual Satanic abuse -- a practice I thought invented by the media. Too, he seems to imply that priests (Roman Catholic? Anglican? Other?) are particularly empowered to cast out demons. What this means to MacNutt's seeming alliance with pentecostal and charismatic groups is not clear.In any event, MacNutt serves up a non-sensationalistic, rational-sounding and well-organized account of a topic that many in the West do not accept. As a hypothesis for the cause of evil in the world, it is fascinating -- especially for those who take Scripture seriously. While not providing a comprehensive theology of evil and its relationship to God, it goes a long way toward making a bizarre topic more acceptable.",positive
0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,4.0,"Has more Bible, less opinion","Recommended by my grandfather Chuck Hunt who is a Methodist Minister in Georgia, this book seemed less hocus pocus than a lot of other spiritual warfare books. MacNutt is a decent writer, but he is careful not to get bogged down in the opinions of what he thinks. Because the Bible is incredibly vague on the specifics of demon possession/oppression and excorcism it's very hard to find a person who isn't either totally denying the presence of demons or blaming every little happenstance on demon possession. Whenever MacNutt mentions his own opinion which isn't mentioned in the Bible, he always points out that it is his opinion, unlike many other authors who try to slip theirs in, unbeknownst to the reader. Very imformative book, probably the only spiritual warfare book I would read in a group setting because any others are too far-fetched and people quickly become uncomfortable.",positive

0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,5.0,An authority on the subject,"Frank MacNutt is a former Roman Catholic priest who left the clergy, I suppose because he was restricted by his bishop in preaching about the true state of affairs regarding Satan, Satan's evil demons (fallen angels) and the havoc they wreak on mankind. The demons have varying and specialized powers (vices, etc.). No one is safe from their attacks, not even the ordained, both physically (if they can muster the power) and spiritually/mentally. But Jesus Christ gave Believers the power over the evil spirits, to still and silence them, and even cast them out thru exorcism and deliverance (the demons don't want you to know this). the evil spirits attempt to control minds and emotions thru a range of mild or severe temptation, influence, oppression, and finally possession, with a basic purpose to offend God, cause man to sin, and turn man away from God. The demons are ultimately condemned, and want you to be condemned like them. I have known many people, influenced and oppressed by evil spirits.""Exorcism,"" a restricted Christian rite, is removing evil spirits from persons, done only by ordained clergy (priests and bishops). ""Deliverance,"" a more simple unrestricted rite of prayers and fasting, can be done by non-ordained persons, but only if they are repented of their sins, in a good state of Grace, and have very strong faith and belief in Jesus Christ (otherwise the demons will ignore them, embarrass them, trick them, or even do harm to them). Best done with a devout prayer group as a backup. It helps to have a Gift of Deliverance/Healing given by the Holy Spirit.Many mainline clergy seem to soft-peddle or ignore the spiritual evil that is ever present either because they put little importance in Spiritual Warfare, or don't want to alarm their congregation. Thus, many people are ignorant of the threat posed by Satan and his demons, and are destroyed by this invisible power. But Frank's apostolate is to make the people aware of Satan's attacks and destruction. I highly recommend reading this down-to-earth and practical book, and taking appropriate action in your life and the lives of your loved ones.How do I know this: thru 30 years of reading on the subject and reading the Bible, where this knowledge is abundantly clear.",positive

0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,1.0,Partly helpful--but some problems,"Although I'm a fan of all of Macnutt's other books, there is a landmine in the middle of this book that renders it dangerous.Particularly helpful are the latter chapters of this book, which deal with practical issues of spiritual deliverance (e.g. forming a team, finding a place, how to prepare). Highly recommended.But then there is chapter 6, a lynchpin chapter for MacNutt, in which he denotes the names of demons. Here, abruptly, he disembarks from the Scriptural foundation on which he's rested his case so far, and depends instead on the highly questionable exegesis found in 'Pigs in the Parlor' (there is not one bible quotation in chapter 6). It is this chapter alone that leads me to give this otherwise good book such a bad review--because naming demons is not a necessary part of deliverance--and it leads to the 'demonization of sin', in which people don't take responsibility for their personal sin, but instead blame it on an evil spirit (i.e. ""I didn't lust after that woman, the devil made me do it"").So do read this book, but read also 'Power Encounters' by David Powlison, a book built on classic evangelical exegesis. Powlison rightly understands that power encounters with evil spirits do happen, but puts it in its proper perspective in terms of personal repentance and accountability for sin.",negative

0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,5.0,An Excellent Book to Include in Studying Deliverance Ministry,"Francis MacNutt approaches deliverance in a reasonable and spiritually-mature manner, as one who has a significant history and practice of deliverance and healing ministry. MacNutt is thoroughly scriptural and Christ-centered in his approach to deliverance. He does not present himself as a super-minister who stands above others in ministry, but he sees himself as part of the larger Christian Body and as one who needs others.MacNutt emphasizes the reality of what we see in Scripture, especially in the gospels and in Jesus' own ministry, in relation to deliverance of demons. He shows how the deliverance ministry is as essential today as it was then and the church needs to be the experts in it. There is plenty of evidence in this book that demonic oppression is active in our cultures and world today.The main contribution of this book is a textbook approach to guiding people in the deliverance ministry. MacNutt gives readers good instruction to inform the ministry. I think he could emphasize more than he does how important a person's own devotional life is when even thinking about deliverance ministry, and this includes the necessity of being plugged into a Biblical Christian community for support and protection.MacNutt also does very well to highlight the relation of demonic oppression/possession to emotional and mental wounds that require inner healing. He advises ministers to be especially careful to not treat mental/physical/emotional wounds as demonic oppression. He repeatedly emphasizes the need for discernment and humility in this work.There is always the danger of people getting obsessed with demons and giving them too much respect and power or in assigning every ailment or sinful habit to demonic influence. MacNutt advises readers to keep a careful balance and to be led by the Spirit in discerning demonic presence.This would be a recommendation for training prayer ministers and as an essential book in one's library. MacNutt offers other suggestions resources.",positive

As Satan is a fallen angel and leader of evil, it behooves us to treat the possibility of evil working in our lives, our culture, our world as real and present.Just as physical disease requires healing, healing from the influence of evil is often necessary to help the person escape the downward spiral of their life.In recent centuries not much attention is given to evil. Perhaps this started with the Protestant reformation. I am not sure. I am sure that their is a reason that some priests are still performing exorcisms in some situations. Some of the protestant churches also perform healings from evil spirits.Just like God, we can choose to not believe, but we can never be sure that God does not exist. We can choose to believe in only good angels, but that does not mean that Satan does not exist.Do some reading. Follow where it leads you. Decide foryourself.

0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,3.0,Evil should hold no power over a good man.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It seems to assign much more power to evil spirits than they actually possess. To go to extremes of ritual and drama to exorcise evil spirits is to assign to them a degree of power that they do not wield. Yet, as the author points out, this approach is not exclusively Christian, or even western, for certain Buddhist sects have also practiced simular rituals. No doubt the practice preceeds any of the surviving major religions.I'm not denying that disincarnate evil actually exists, but it cannot hold power over you unless you are operating at the same low level. It is far better to contemplate the Good in creation. Evil spirits can only enter a heart, or a mind, if it is empty of Good to start with.",neutral
0800792327,Deliverance from Evil Spirits: A Practical Manual,1.0,An Orthodox view on Healing,"As Orthodox Christians we pray, neither commanding God to heal, nor doubting His ability to heal, but pleading for His promised mercy upon all who are ill. The Orthodox Church has never believed or behaved as though the gifts of the Spirit or the healing miracles of Christ have somehow passed away. Did not Jesus promise, ""He who belives in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father"" John 14:12St. Ireneaus, writing at the close of the second century, speaks of miracles in his day: ""Some drive out devils...some have foreknowledge of the future...others heal the sick through the laying on of hands...and even the dead have been raised up before now and have remained with us for many years.""Even in the nineteenth century a Russian Monk (St. Serphim of Sarov) was blessed with the gift of healing.

This message is unpopular to many who profess to be believers. We are warned all through scripture to beware, watch out and stay alert for false teachers and false doctrines and yet, when we bring God's word to many of the professing/believing church today in order to protect her from seduction, she becomes a wall against sound biblical truth, hard and unyielding.Too much daydreaming in life leaves our minds open to very real fantasies that 'seem' more enjoyable than reality at the time but in the end leave us with nothing but dreams that have turned into personal nightmares. We've sat unknowingly with a dark, wicked task master dressed in light and because of our lack of vision we perish. Prov. 29:18When our lives are graded, many will have failed the test with no more grace for a do over.The Church has not done her homework and instead has let someone else cheat her right into a recess like faith that steals her mind and dulls her understanding while she's enjoying life her way, not THE WAY.Fortunately, it is not too late to 'study to show ourselves approved by God, a workman who is not ashamed and can RIGHTLY divide the Word of Truth."" 2 Tim. 2:15This book is a great aid in helping us become more alert and watchful concerning the last days that Jesus warned us about.No one knows when the bell will ring, when the trumpet blast shall sound and time will be no more...yes, we are in the last of the last days!Will He find us faithful?

0595319432,Cold Wing Dinner,5.0,Remarkable View into How & Why,"For those who wish to glimpse the darker manifestations of inner-city poverty ridden motivations, here is an excellent place to start. Countless stories have been told of similar tales that seriously lack the nuance necessary to convey the characters' humanity in all their absurd and fault-ridden conclusions to life's predicaments. Such is not the case in this instance; you will move through the existence of these characters as if their world were yours. As many of us know (exactly as the title suggests) a ""Cold Wing Dinner"" is generally not the meal of choice, but man is it satisfying.",positive
0595319432,Cold Wing Dinner,5.0,Very good storytelling of a story seldom told,"At first glance, Brian Ray's Cold Wing Dinner may seem to be yet another tale about life in Urban America.That first impression is filled in early as this wonderful novel quickly unfolds as something so much more. It is a well-told, and passionatly written story about the type of American family that is often dismissed as a collection of negative stats and sterotypes.The characters in Cold Wing Dinner quickly flesh out as people we are unacustomed to seeing in contemporary Black fiction, and their story is composed of situations we are not used to reading in such realistic and rich detail.Cold Wing Dinner honors the family that is the subject of the novel through a candid accounting of their lives that will not let you put the book aside. It leads you through the downward spiraling of their lives without patronizing them or the reader. The characters are among the &quot;realest&quot; people I have read in fiction in a while. I loved them, I hated them, I KNOW them. At different times I found myself yelling at them, cheering for them and wondering what the hell was wrong with 'em. Much pivots on the mother, but not in the way we are used to reading. She is something!The contexts of the family's struggles, and the members' individual battles, are sincere and laid out so well. Even a reader who has not personally lived that life, can understand it. It is a bold story. It does not blast the stereotypes of poor people as much as it fills in the shadows and gives them a humanity we rarely see in fiction.",positive

B000PFYWOU,The Gospel According to Luke X-XXIV Anchor Bible,5.0,One of the most detailed Luke Commentaries.,"`The Gospel According to Luke I - IX' and `The Gospel According to Luke X - XXIV' by Professor Joseph Fitzmyer comprises the `Anchor Bible' series commentary on the Gospel of Luke, the third Evangelist. The very best thing I can say about this work is that virtually every other commentary, from all ends of the spectrum, cites this work as a reliable authority on the subject. One should still take some care before investing in the purchase of a copy of these two relatively pricy volumes.The first consideration is that you may actually have trouble finding the first volume, as it appears to be out of print. I was lucky enough to get it from an alternate source available through Amazon, and I'm quite happy to have acquired it, as it lives up to its reputation in every way. But here we meet a second consideration. This is the fact that this great work, weighing in at over 1600 pages, is at the highly scholarly end of the spectrum of Gospel commentaries. The only work which may be larger is the three volume study by John Nolland in the `Word Biblical Commentary' series. Aside from being just a bit shorter, I like Fitzmyer far more than Nolland because Fitzmyer's format is far more accessible to the non-scholar. And yet, it is still a work almost exclusively for exegesis. For hermeneutics and pastoral use, most of Fitzmyer's information will only work as deep background. The lion's share of the commentary is dedicated to the study of the most basic documentary sources, lexical issues, and exegesis. For example, there are frequent references to the original Codices found from the third, fourth, and fifth centuries, and to the slight differences in text found in alternate documents. For the Bible scholar, these are necessary. For the lay Bible study student or teacher, they are a distraction. Thankfully, makes them less of a distraction than Nolland and the rather Byzantine structure of the texts in the `Word' series.With great humility, I may also suggest that Fitzmyer's translation of the Gospel tends to the `politically correct', as when he translates the Greek word for `slave' as `servant'. The NRSV translates this as `slave' and in the Greek text; the dominant meaning is `slave' according to both a Greek dictionary and the `Dictionary of New Testament Theology'.In spite of all these considerations, I, a lowly amateur teacher of Bible studies, still find Fitzmyer extremely valuable (as I do Nolland, if I have time to wade through his pages.) The first and foremost value I find might be the highly valuable `serendipitous' finding. There is so much here, on can hardly help tripping over something really useful. The latest finding is a reference to a work on New Testament theology, an aspect of scriptural study which is almost totally absent from Bible commentaries. Another great value I've found is that in spite of the `politically correct' translation, I find Fitzmyer's explanations of many words, as with Jesus talking about the Pharisees' `leaven' or `yeast', his explanation is far better than any other volume. And, his use of `leaven' is probably far more accurate than `yeast', as I suspect Hellenistic science had not the faintest knowledge of these microorganisms, even though they were thoroughly familiar with natural leavening. Lastly, I find Fitzmyer's introduction to the Gospel one of the best (although Johnson's introduction (see below) is also excellent for a smaller price). This is especially unfortunate, as it appears in the hard to get first volume.If you are looking for only pastoral guidance, I recommend Joel Green's commentary or the New Interpreter's Bible. If you want a brief of this exegesis, go for Luke Timothy Johnson's excellent commentaries on Luke (and Acts).My last thoughts about these volumes is that they bring me back to my very first experience with Biblical exegesis and the Anchor Bible, which was launched in the late 1950s, but which seems to have fallen on hard times, as the reputation and availability of many of its volumes is thin.",positive
0688156584,The Martini Shot: A Novel,5.0,Kampai!,"I don't know, I think this book was pretty damn funny. I don't even pretend to understand what &quot;hollywood&quot; is all about, but, although Charlie's reflective scene before he douses himself may have been a bit maudlin, the characters are what make it... You want to adopt Matt, shoot Barb (with cellulite), share a joint with Camilla, BE Ava, and have a couple of Chrisses ... As far as the criticism of one-liners goes, how fitting for Charlie to end up &quot;in the drink&quot;... The wit and sarcasm of these &quot;one-liners&quot; has made me oddly homesick for that so very AMERICAN sense of humor.

I read it, and agreed for the most part, except I felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier than I had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than I would have thought from the initial satirical tone. The ending was a little over the top, but it was an example of the kind of senseless fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives.

1585676187,Anthony Powell: A Life,5.0,A dance to the music of the author,"For any fan of the incredible series ""A Dance to the Music of Time"", this is a must-read. The characters portrayed in that series were based on people the author knew, and Barber has gone to great lengths to attached the original person to the character in the book.Powell's life itself is fascinating, and Barber has done a very good job of leading the reader through it. Powell was a member of one of the most famous generations in British literature, thus, with this book, one gets a view of that group of people, as well as the environment that produced them. Powell's relationships with various members of the group make for some of the most interesting parts of the book. For example, he and Evelyn Waugh were competitors (and Waugh didn't like anyone who competed with him) and their poisonously friendly exchanges are fun to read. Powell's relationship with Malcolm Muggeridge is another problematic friendship in the book.Barber is a good writer, and he tells the story of Powell's life clearly and well. He describes the critical events in Powell's upbringing (esp. his attendance at Eton) and points out how these events affected the person Powell became. He also explains the basis for each of Powell's novels, which, as a reader of these works, I found very interesting.Barber does not cover Powell's marriage and his children is any but a cursory manner, and the book would likely have been better had that been more fully examined. One learns more about his relationships with his parents and brother than with his wife and children, and this gap is bothersome.Anthony Powell was a private man from middle-class means who married a member of the nobility, and his quest for wealth dictated most of his actions. The parallels between him and Waugh are striking, but whereas Waugh was not at all a nice man, Powell shows to be a more humane and less judgmental person.This is a good book for anyone interested in the period, and an excellent one for those who love Powell's magnum opus.",positive
1585676187,Anthony Powell: A Life,4.0,Fails to Bring Powell to Life,"Michael Barber's immense biography is a benchmark in Anthony Powell studies, but that does not mean it is without fault. Over its length Barber becomes intimately familiar with Powell's idiosyncrasies, but he does not take into account how trying they will seem to the majority of his readers. At every turn, he is obsessed with status and with class; this bias was probably useful in composing his novels, especially the amazing tour de force that was his roman fleuve A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME, but it does not make for a very nice person perhaps.Oh well, perhaps we ask the gods for too much if we expect a talented author to have a charming personalitu as well. And indeed Powell (pronounced ""Pole"" as in fishing pole) did have his charms, especially when he wanted something from you. As Barber shows us, he despised Graham Greene's writing, calling him a third-rate Joseph Conrad, who had the temerity to add ""Roman Catholic propaganda"" to an insipid stew, and yet he found it easier to pretend to like him to his face, even calling him ""cher confrere,"" --until Greene's death, and then he could pour out the venom he had secreted.Barber also discusses Powell's friendship with the doomed, damned composer Constant Lambert, who also figures in the recent Meredith Daneham biography of Margot Fonteyn (he was her lover and mentor early on). Powell satirized Lambert as one of the characters in his novel, as indeed he did everyone who he met and knew well. Daneham provides a more compassionate portrait of Lambert, Barber a colder one, following the lead of Powell, who seems to have had great satisfaction in outliving almost everyone else and then telling the world what he was not able (due to stringent libel laws) to hint at in fictional terms.We learn the origin of nearly every character and plot point in the DANCE, and that is the great use of this biography. I can't imagine reading another biography of this dreary man, so I expect my final impression of him will be one who, like Evelyn Waugh, saw only the worst in mankind, and made money doing so.",positive
1585676187,Anthony Powell: A Life,1.0,Dance to no music with two left feet,"Having thoroughly enjoyed both my readings of Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, I looked forward to learning more about the author and his work. Having read this book, I still do. The cover photograph acts as a helpful warning - yes, an arty (or at least black & white) photo of Powell is used, but there is, almost in the middle, a big blurry bit, which if you look closely is a cat. Apparently Powell liked cats, but this does not make the picture any more interesting or appropriate. The preface, with Barber's self abasing o how should I refer to the Great Man I am not worthy paragraph, provides an even stronger warning about the problem of continuing the book...If Barber cannot bring himself, without ludicrous cringing, to refer to Powell according to biographical convention, how can the reader rely upon him to produce a useful book? The early part of the biography, dealing with Powell's family background (important for someone so interested in genealogy) and education at Eton gives very little impression of Powell himself, who does not really appear in the book until he has finished at Oxford. In the meantime, we are provided with random facts and gossip about people and things at both Eton and Oxford, which mean little to those who were not there. More explanations and concentration on Powell's experiences would help. Surely, at Oxford especially, there could be more about the social conditions there when Powell was up (not just that it wasnt like Brideshead, I think most people have worked that one out)given the interwar years were quite interesting. We could be clearly informed of what he read & perhaps why, and been spared Barber's little joke about it being at Oxford then 'sapiens to be homo', which only adds to the pain. Indeed, we could be spared many little jokes and clever uses of quotes. We are admirers of Powell's writing, not Barber's.As Powell starts work & engages more with the world, Barber brings him a little more into focus. Sadly, it is hard to see him in the crowds of nearly every single person he ever met being shown to be important to the Dance. And again, we dont necessarily learn who these people are or were, other than that they were part of the correct cliques. Barber repeats gossip without necessarily supporting it (as about Gerald Duckworth's assult of his step sister Virginia Stephens [later Woolf] - possibly true, but included for no real reason other than chat), and without a clear narrative, everything just jumbles together. The Second World War provides at least some direction, and the years following it, as Powell wrote the Dance, are a bit easier to follow, but Barber continues confuse Powell's life and the development of his work. The reader is informed that the Dance was originally intended to be in six parts - Why? When did it change to 12? Why did this happen? The odd friend & reviewer seems to have known this, but not others. What about the non-reviewing readership? And why wouldn't Americans be able to cope with books with a first person narrator, as Barber claims?Powell's later life, as he finished the Dance, is a little less crowded, and reading about literary fights is always amusing - but why do we need to know that Barber calls Auberon Waugh Bron? - , yet we still learn little about the development of the book over the years. Barber notes that Powell was interviewed regularly, but provides little information as to what he said in the interviews. The accounts of Barber's own interview and lunch with Powell are provided, and one cannot but help agree with Powell's assesment. The reader is regularly informed of Powell's snobbery, which is an widely-agreed upon component of his work and life, but again Barber makes little effort to demonstrate the role it played. Perhaps it is Barber's lack of access to Powell's personal papers, and Powell did keep his personal life out of the public eye, but the near absolute lack of reference to his family is troublesome. The absence of Powell's parents from the time they send him to Eton until they die (with only the noting in passing of his father's refusal to buy in to Duckworths to help Powell's career) is odd, especially given Barber's view that everyone Powell met influenced the Dance - surely his parents would have some influence beyond what we see of Jenkin's parents in the book? There is little discussion of them as such, either, for all that this is an unauthorised biography.While the plots of Powell's other books are often described in detail, the Dance remains a little more vague - it is not a readily described story, but surely a biographer could try somewhat? Some but not all characters from the Dance are mentioned, but not always explained, and those people whom Barber thinks contributed to them are noted, but again not always with an explaination or argument as to why he thinks so. An example is the character of Max Pilgrim,for whom Barber suggests a couple of real people as inspiration, but not Noel Coward, who is named in most other discussions of Pilgrim. There is little discussion of Powell's most memorable creation in the Dance, Widmerpool, about whom so much could be said.Michael Barber's biography of Anthony Powell fails to inform the reader very much at all about Powell's life or the creation of his literary masterpiece, Dance to the Music of Time. We do learn some gossip about people in various literary, intellectual, and social cliques at the time, we are informed that Powell and his narrator were very similar, and that Powell looked for inspiration in his life for his work. Overall, one can only agree with Powell's own assesment of Barber - uninspiring, to say the least.",negative
1585676187,Anthony Powell: A Life,4.0,Reasonable biography of a fascinating author,"I suppose I am biased in that I really like Anthony Powell's 12 volume sequence Dance to the Music of Time and have read it twice.This is not a great biography as such, but what it lacks in insights and theory of mind of the subject, it makes up for in interesting links between Powell's work and his life. As such it is a fascinating social history of the times he lived in and the interesting people (like Orwell, Waugh) that he knew. So I read it in almost one sitting. Powell ultimately remains elusive, an observer not fully observed. Powell himself hints at voyeurism in some of his characters, and ultimately in the same way, his central character Widmerpool remains a sort of Citizen Kane. Somehow I wonder if anyone could get to know him better?When I think by comparison of the biographies of say George Orwell, they ultimately seem to leave me knowing quite a bit about who Orwell was and what he would have been like to know as a friend. With Powell, I am not blaming his biographer. I think Powell set out in his work, his journals and his articles to remain fundamentally elusive. Which is why I guess there is an Anthony Powell Society and such continuing fascination with his works.",positive

B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",1.0,"Some flawed logic, hard to read, and poor naratives","The bottom line is that you're looking for an unbiased straight facts from authors without an agenda, you had better keep looking. This ain't it.After reading the Da Vinci's Code, I was pretty sure that Dan Brown used at least some artistic license as to the facts of the matter. None the less I was fascinated by some of the scenarios in the book was motivated to learn more about Jesus and the history of Christianity.So when I saw the book 'Cracking Da Vinci's Code' I was immediately interested, figured it would be great to get an unbiased opinion.Boy was I wrong. If Dan Brown was extreme, the two theologians that wrote this book are as bad or worse then he is, just from the other side. The scary thing is that while we all know that we're reading fiction in the Da Vinci's code--some may accept the 'Cracking' book as a pure truth, which I think would be dangerous.One of my biggest complaints is that they have questions that they will supposedly answer, such as &quot;Is it true that the Church has repositioned sex as evil...&quot; and their answer is basically, &quot;No... It is true that *some* but not all of the early church folks believed this but not all. I'm hoping they will tackle or at least justify things like the fact that Catholic Priests and Nuns are still required to take a vow of celibicy, etc. and that obviously the Church is still the major purveyor's of sexual opression.

They are pure torture to read--the worst type of propoganda, pure and simple. It seriously reminds me of those insane 'public service movies' like Reefer Madness from the decades past--written by one demographic to try to appeal to another that they clearly don't understand and it ends up coming across as completely phony. I couldn't imagine two authors more out of touch with their own characters.",negative
B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",1.0,Bitterly Disappointing Response,"This book is an excellent affirmation of Christian values that must be read by anyone who didn't realize that ""The Da Vinci Code"" was a work of fiction. Please reread that sentence; ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a work of fiction, like ""Star Trek"" or ""Harry Potter"". Unfortunately, the same people who fail to appreciate this fact are the same people who actually need to read ""Cracking Da Vinci's Code,"" in order to restore balance to a worldview so easily upset by Dan Brown's clever yarn.Unfortunately, this book is poor ammunition for anyone actually hopeing to defend the Christian faith from a popular fascination with the romanticized Cult of the Magdelene presented by Dan Brown. Doctors Garlow and Jones, both highly educated evangelists, have crafted a book that is more or less comfort food for their audience, not any scholarly attempt to address the factual underpinnings of Brown's novel. Somewhat pointedly, Garlow and Jones choose some of the weaker elements of Brown's novel to base their case on. For instance, by way of dealing with non-Canon gospels (the Gnostic gospels, and the somewhat-less-offensive Apocryphal texts), Garlow and Jones give a selective history of the Council of Nicea which posits that they merely reaffirmed a version of the New Testament already in circulation. This is somewhat true, but ignores how the wording of the gospels were decided to specifically reaffirm the Nicean view of Christianity at the expense of other popular Churches of the time (including churches established by the very disciples of Jesus). They cast aspersions on non-Canon texts without actually addressing why they are or aren't considered reliable. Likewise, when it comes to a discussion of Paganism and its influence on Christian theology, the authors steadfastly refuse to acknowledge even the possiblity (much less the accepted fact) that rituals central to Christianity - such as baptism, the eucharist, and chrism (annointing with oil or ashe) - were all employed by pagan cults for thousands of years prior to Christianity. Instead, Garlow and Jones rely on the emotional impact of the epithet ""pagan"" on their reader to cast aspersions and reinforcce doubt.Most disappointing about this book is that the authors attack fiction with fiction. Where there exist stronger points in the scholarship that underpin Brown's fiction (and I can't emphasize enough that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is JUST an entertaining story), Garlow and Jones turn instead to a fictional couples experience attending a discussion group of Brown's book and it's central thesis, which naturally involve secularist ridicule of faithful Christians engaged in acts of ministry.There are even a few instances where the authors manufacture assertions by inferral that were never made by Brown or any of his characters. Half way through this book, I got the distinct impression that neither Garlow or Jones (nor their editor) ever actually read Browns fictional works.This is one of those rare books where I was relieved to finally have finished it. There is no vice in the spirited defense of ones faith through the presentation of facts in support of rational argument. Unfortunately, this book is very light on facts, and frequently resorts to emotional arguments. The Gospels tell us that Jesus himself debated with authority found in a thorough knowledge of the law, and was skilled in avoiding rhetorical traps. Garlow and Jones do the opposite: they count on the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the general population, and frequently employ rhetorical traps. Anyone seeking to be Christ-like, and defend their faith, would do well to not rely on this book.",negative

The writing is dry, stale, and wholly uninspiring. It seems not so much committed to really getting into a lot of what Brown said in The Da Vinci Code, but rather, interested in defending Jesus Christ as Lord. But I could get this same thing from any number of excellent books which were written for that specific purpose.I have no problem with Christians, Christianity, or whatever, but I do have a problem with a book claiming that it is going to do one thing, then does not deliver.Wait for other books to come along that dissect Brown's book (there are bound to be more). They will probably be cheaper and better thought out. This one seemed rushed and choppy (note two authors) and reads like it was pieced together to simply ride the wave.If you want a book defending Christianity, look elsewhere.

This book is neither! It doesn't well agrue any bibical agruement, but rather makes a rather open statement then moves on. I felt there was no research at all going into this Cracking the Da Vinci code.

B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",4.0,"Countering the ""Da Vinci Code"" Anti-Christian Bigotry","Garlow and Jones soundly refute the charge that the church was and is antisex. But then again, this is an age-old trumped-up charge, going back to ancient pagan Rome, and still leveled against those who do not agree with the hedonistic and libertinistic practices of the accusers. The same holds for those who accuse the church of being sexist or misogynist (anti-woman), as the Da Vinci Code does. It is routine for feminists to call anyone sexist or misogynist who has the temerity to disagree with their ideology or their policies.Garlow and Jones show that there was no such thing as a matriarchial society. They also expose the irony of the fact that the Da Vinci Code presents the Gnostic writings in a positive light even though Gnostic writings contain obvious misogyny!Garlow and Jones elaborate on the persecution of witches. It turns out that most instances of such persecution were instigated by secular rather than religious authorities. What's more, witch-baiting is a great exaggeration. The number of victims was quite small--perhaps 50,000 witches executed over a long period of time, certainly not millions. What Garlow and Jones do not mention is the fact that the persecution of others by the Christian church is dwarfed by the persecution of others by atheists. The hundreds of thousands of victims sent to the guillotine by the Jacobins during the French Revolution and the tens of millions of innocent people murdered by the atheistic Communists come to mind.A major shortcoming of Garlow and Jones' book is his failure to contextualize the DaVinci Code trash as a manifestation of overt anti-Christian bigotry--yes, a form of bigotry that would never be applied to any other religion. After all, the DaVinci Code (yes, I have read the book) not only attacks the Christian faith as an error, but accuses the church of being a deliberate conspiracy that is attempting to conceal a fraud. The fact that it is admittedly fictional does not change the fact of this bigotry. If Hollywood made a fictional film accusing the Prophet Mohammed of being a fraud and concocting a conspiracy to hide the true origins of Islam, it would be widely denounced as Islamophobic bigotry. Were Hollywood to make a film that positively portrays the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, even as fiction, it would be universally condemned as anti-Semitic. The real lesson of the DaVinci Code that needs to be stressed by Garlow, Jones, and others is the fact that anti-Christian bigotry is now just about the only acceptable form of bigotry, and that this is an ominous portent for the future.

It was a great response to Brown's work and gave me a sense of peace that those who are floundering or looking for a religion have an answer for Brown's very convincing lies.

Despite brown's prologue about his book being entirely fictional, it is simply a great novel.

This book is an fundamentalist evangelical paranoid defense against the perceived threats from a work of fiction.The authors make up strawmen arguments to counter fictional situations and then blow up their own straw men using techniques to include mocking, fiction, false equivalence and guilt by association. One of my favorites was the claim that our national leaders are promoting paganism for us as evidenced by the fact that someone Hillary Clinton knows shares some pagan beliefs. I didn't bother to verify the claim which even if conceded as true without question is a pretty weak basis to make the claim our national leaders are pushing paganism upon us. Sadly, that was probably the strongest argument in the book.An undergraduate student in Logic would have no problem finding numerous instances of fallacies in the arguments put forth in the book, and even those unfamiliar with logical reasoning should be able to find them although they may not recognize the formal names of each. False equivalency is one that appears commonly and repeatedly throughout. While I can't recommend the book for its supposed relevance to the Dan Brown Novel, it would serve as an excellent reference in a Logic class for identifying logical fallacies in arguments. The book excels at putting emotion before reason, attacking perceived threats through name calling, guilt by association, and simply attributing things the authors have made up to their supposed opposition and then shooting down their own strawmen as if it were an accomplishment.Those having terribly weak faith so easily threatened by works of fiction may find some solice herein.

In the novel, Brown shows us just how poorly informed he really is regarding ancient and medieval Christian history. The very fact that Brown relied heavily upon the 1982 work of spurious history entitled &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail,&quot; by Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh (Brown's character Leigh Teabing is a nod to these authors; &quot;Teabing&quot; is an anagram for &quot;Baigent&quot;)-a book not taken seriously by any scholar I'm familiar with, Christian or otherwise, tells one all one needs to know about his &quot;scholarship,&quot; or lack thereof. As a student of both ancient and medieval Christian history, I can state categorically that the arguments made in &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail,&quot; are based purely in the authors' fertile imaginations. Such claims as they make are laughable-or would be, if so many people weren't taking them seriously. The claims that the Knights Templar were some sort of secret occult magicians, or guardians of the Holy Grail, in particular, is a myth which refuses to die, in spite of the research of Templar experts Dr. Malcolm Barber and Peter Partner. In fact, few of the claims Brown makes through his fictional character Teabing, are based in actual fact.In &quot;Cracking Da Vinci's Code,&quot; the authiors explain how Brown's assertions through his fictional characters that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and the Church has been covering it up for centuries are hardly new arguments; then they give you the real history of people and places mentioned in &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot; Further, the authors expose an agenda at work, one that is anti-thetical to traditional Christianity.Why am I bothered by all this, you may ask. Well, the claims of this novel wouldn't be worth worrying about or answering but for the fact that too many people are taking this work of fiction as being based upon sound historical research.&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is FICTION, folks, as is its premise.But, if you want fact and not fiction, &quot;Cracking Da Vinci's Code&quot; is a must-read.

B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",5.0,The Code Decoded,"A new category of book has arisen during our troubled, postmodern times. Often widely acclaimed, sometimes extremely popular, always playing fast and loose with known and verified history, these books claim to have uncovered the real facts about a particular topic, be it Christian origins (books by John Dominic Crossan, Elaine Pagels, and various members of the Jesus Seminar), the Catholic Church's relationship to the Jews (John Carroll), or Christianity's understanding of homosexuality (John Boswell). What they really do is engage in a kind of disreputable approach to research, what I term ""advocacy scholarship."" They share a common understanding: If their core insight is valid (or just fashionable)--e.g., Jesus came to destroy ""the brokered kingdom"" (Crossan), Gnostic Christianity is just as true as Orthodox Christianity (Pagels), homosexuality is a valid lifestyle (Boswell), traditional Catholicism is repressive and enslaving (Carroll)--they are justified in using disreputable practices such as extremely selective use of sources, false attribution, ""cooking"" the data, and just plain falsification of history.These books all have one thing in common: they claim to present an ""alternate history,"" one that has been suppressed by powerful forces of tyranny, usually for political reasons. The alternate history they present will enable readers to free themselves from tyrannies of their own times, be they religious, political, or social. Seeking to place themselves in a long line of freedom movements, they borrow the language of social and political liberation and misapply it to their topic at hand. I call these works fake history. They find an audience (sometimes incredibly large) because of two factors that plague our postmodern times: 1) nearly ubiquitous ignorance on the part ofaverage ""educated"" individuals in the West; and 2) the rise of a view that all narratives are equally valid.Perhaps the worst of all these books is Dan Brown's wildly fantastical work posing as history, The Da Vinci Code. Let us be clear up front. Dan Brown has every right to write a novel that presents his understanding of Christian origins, the glories of paganism, the marvels of the sacred feminine, the horrors of Orthodox Christianity, and the liberating power of goddess religion. My objection to his work has nothing to do with whether or not he is free to express his opinion on such topics. My objection to him and his methods is that he claims to present a true, sustainable, historically accurate picture of what really has happened when in reality there is little or no evidence for his claims, although he acts as if there is, both throughout the book and in subsequent appearances on talk shows and in interviews. This is simply disreputable. He is nothing more than a somewhat higher class of snake-oil salesman, a shill for discredited ideas, a mouthpiece for historical inanity that cannot be supported at the most basic level of serious inquiry. Somehow, he has managed to pull of this shameful scam, due largely to massive ignorance on the part of his readers combined with a deep desire on their part to find an alibi for their own wayward impulses toward license which are celebrated and blessed in this scurrilous work.Thank goodness for Messieurs Garlow and Jones. Men of no little standing in the world of thought and letters (one with a Ph.D. in historical theology from Drew University, the other with a Ph.D. from Princeton), authors of a baker's dozen of books, they have taken up the gauntlet thrown down by Dan Brown and produced a very readable response to--let's not mince words here--his idiotic book.What I admire about Cracking Da Vinci's Code is the care the authors take in exposing this fraudulent work, all the while maintaining a cheerful good humor and writing in a very popular and approachable style. True, they have little time for Brown's fake history, but they have the good manners to engage it seriously and without rancor at the level of the adequacy of its presentation of facts (something I find impossible to do when faced with nonsense of this kind). This would hardly have been necessary if the book had been written in a different genre, such as alternate history science fiction--but then it would've lost its cache, its frisson, its stance (albeit false) as authentic history, wouldn't've it?Along the way, they clearly show that there is absolutely no foundation for its appalling claims, such as the idea that the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus came about as the result of a politically motivated vote by the Council of Nicaea; that alternative, ""Gnostic"" gospels were written earlier than the four gospels in the New Testament and present a truer understanding of who Jesus was than the Christian gospels; that there is evidence that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and that they had a child; that the Church has suppressed this evidence because it would undermine its power and break the hold it has on the faithful; that the Church killed more than five million women in a brutal attempt at ""reeducation""; and lots more similar idiocy.I have only two quibbles, and these are entirely minor. First, I don't think the book are fairly describes the post-Constantine Church; and second, I'm not entirely taken with their running chapter-opening narrative concerning a young woman who is struggling to make up her mind about the value of The Da Vinci Code. Regarding the first quibble, it has become fairly standard for Protestant church historians to discredit the post-Constantine church, so it's not unexpected (although one might wish for a more nuanced approach). Regarding the second, I can see the usefulness to situate the dilemma Brown's book poses for the historically illiterate by creating a story to help readers find existential connecting points; for me, however, it was a little heavy-handed.Nevertheless, this is quite a good book, certainly worth checking out, especially for those who, credulously, have taken the historicity of The Da Vinci Code at face value. 4 and 1/2 stars.",positive

But the narrative is quite useful in understanding the types of arguments and beliefs you can encounter with devotees of DVC and how to respond to them.

""The Priory of Sion,"" claimed to be the keeper of the secrets since the Middle Ages, is a complete hoax, started in France in the 1950s by a person who thought himself to be heir to the French throne (112). Nearly all of the New Testament was documented as recognized scripture by no later than 200 AD, or 125 years before the Council of Nicaea (142), contrary to DVC's claim. Christ's divinity was not decided by a ""close vote"" at Nicaea as claimed by DVC: the vote was ""two"" against and over 300 ""for"" (96).In summary, this book adeptly exposes the major supposed ""facts"" that Dan Brown claims DVC is based on as a series of neat deceptions and lies, and built upon the wishful thinking of the aging New Age Movement.",positive

The key take-away not apparent to a casual reader of The Da Vinci Codes is that Brown is promoting a paganist agenda and did a lousy job of researching basic information. For example no modern scholar believes that 5 million women were executed by the church in order to destroy the myth of the feminine. Also taking the mythical document Q as a reference is ridiculous, no one has ever seen or read the thing. Probably Q does not exist, yet Brown makes it part of his science fiction story.Personally I dont think it matters if Christ had descendants. He would still be everything that he is in the Bible, with an extra dollop of humanity. Garlow and Jones remind us that there is zero evidence of Christ's legacy. Absolutely none, unless you take seriously writings of a crazed Frenchman who claims that he is the descendant of Christ.Garlow and Jones are very willing to criticize the church when that is called for, and over 2000 years, one needs to take the good with the bad.

B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",2.0,About as Biased as Dan Brown,"A neighbor gave me this book to read. I have read the DaVinci Code and I thought it was good fiction mixed with some fact. Of Course Dan Brown strings together many unrelated truths half truths and fabrications to make his story interesting, so it is quite easy to write an expose showing where he stepped over the line. This critique of The DaVinci Code goes too far the other way trying to spin ""Orthodox"" Christianity as the only true religion and the ""Orthodox"" point of view the only ""true"" history of the last 2000 years. The authors have dumbed down the subject matter, omitted information and scholarship contrary to their point of view, and created a book that borders on propaganda. One part of the book that I found very annoying was the failure to address the historical excesses of institutional or ""Orthodox"" Christianity. The Authors criticise Brown for writing that the Church (both Catholic and Protestant) Burned or otherwise murdered ""Millions"" of heretics. The authors concede that the number is closer to 50 or 60 thousand. So which is worse? Making a mistake concerning the number of heretics murdered? Or defending the institution that actually murdered thousands of people? (And I would assume if we add in the Crusades both against the Muslims and the ""heretics"" we'd probably get a lot closer to the million than thousand figure.) Another spin made by the authors actually caused me to laugh out loud. You should read how these ""Orthodox"" scholars are spinning the female responsibility for the fall/oppression of females nexus. Here's what they say. The original sin in the Bible was Adam not working hard enough to spiritually protect his family. This is a very ""unorthodox"" and ""unbiblical spin designed to distract you from the fact that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have for centuries oppressed women because Eve ate the Fruit First. What does Brother Paul say about it11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp* authority over the man, but to be in silence*.13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.15 Notwithstanding she* shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobrietyI think Paul would be very angry reading the Author's attempt to put a ""new age"" spin the scripture to fit a more modern interpretation of the story. This spin also flies in the face of Christian History. And I do not feel any better about it even though the Authors point out that pagan cultures have abused women as well. So what? Do two wrongs make a right? If Orthodox Christianity is ""true"" why did it take the institution almost 2000 years to figure out that men and women were equal and figure out that the story in Genesis and Paul's exposition of it were wrong?Ultimately this book fails because it is plain dishonest. Yes it points out some issues where Dan Brown obviously inflates the truth, or even creates it out of nothing. Brown's book has historical errors and it does have a point of view and an agenda. However, this does not excuse the propaganda and misdirection contained in ""Cracking Da Vinci's Code.""",negative
B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",4.0,"The other side of ""The DaVinci Code""","The fact that ""The DaVinci Code"" has been a spectacular financial success is beyond dispute. It has perched at or near the top of the Best Seller List for many weeks. In his book, under the guise of fiction, Dan Brown makes some phenomenal assertions. He refutes the basis of the Christian religion, namely that Jesus is the son of God and He is the only way to salvation. In this book, two Christian theologians dispute this viewpoint and defend the Christian faith. They assert that the sources which Dan Brown uses to make his claim are faulty and have been proven to be so. Some of their arguments are a little ""soft"", such as the fact that the Bible contains the stories of Deborah, Tamar, Rahab, and Mary, and therefore Christianity is not anti-female. A more compelling argument is the treatment of women by Jesus himself, who showed love and concern for all people, regardless of gender or status. Many people say that this debate is not important, that ""The DaVinci Code"" is merely cleverly-written fiction. Dan Brown has give numerous interviews that show that he clearly had an agenda for writing the book. Garlow and Jones point out his agenda and demonstrate the danger which ""The DaVinci Code"" gives in presenting paganism and gnosticism as a viable alternative to Christianity. They make a point that people have two choices in their religious beliefs: they can either worship the Creator or that which He Created. The authors also show that in our ""feel-good"" society, the allure of these ancient relgious practices is very enticing. Dan Brown uses his characters in a convincing way to demonstrate what he sees as the validity of his beliefs. Garlow and Jones are less successful with their fictional character, Carrie.

Many readers have found themselves more interested in the information detailed in Dan Brown's books, and if so, this book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the ""lost"" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism.Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times.The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest. At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene.This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts. He said:""Now I know why. The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was `the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says, `When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.' No wonder they suppressed this stuff! The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff. Real `Us' versus `them' stuff, the polar opposite from `God is within You.' `My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through ""my"" door/denomination. But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity `within you and without you.'""Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general:The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament.Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 ) is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John.James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition. It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502.The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079) by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates. His commentary generates strong reactions.Elaine Pagels has 2 books (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately. For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation. She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking. While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim. As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present. Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time.If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume New Testament Apocrypha.Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view",negative
B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",1.0,Fanaticism at it's worst...,"I feel I must preface this review with the statement that Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" is fiction. He states that himself. He also states that the historical information (such as the documents, artwork, and societies mentioned) are fact. Now, before you get your collective panties in a bunch, he ALSO states that 'history is written by the winners...' (to paraphrase). Therefore, his interpretation of history may be just as skewed as everyone elses...Now having said that, this bit of drivel, namely ""Cracking Da Vinci's Code"", is no more than a flagrant, and decidedly desparate, attempt to save face by individuals who have a vested interest in ensuring the teachings of the Bible are not besmirched in any way (didn't 'Jim' say he was a Pastor of a church...?). If what's written in ""The Da Vinci Code"" is actually true, then these people have some explaining to do, don't you think?Anyway, by the time I got to page 38 (which isn't very far into the book, I can tell you), I came to the realization that none of the points the authors were trying to make were, in fact, being made. They were twisting the ideas and words used by Dan Brown in his book (and in many cases, blatantly fabricating them) to make their points (and not very successfully, I might add). As I finished reading each chapter, I came away with the feeling that something was missing... mainly, the proof they were attempting to provide!I will give you one GLARING example of a fabricated attempt to disprove Mr. Brown in his book: the authors state that Dan Brown says (and I am paraphrasing here, so please excuse me) that the rose (an anagram of Eros, the god of sexual love) is the premiere symbol of female sexuality. I have no problem with that at all. The authors then go on a diatribe about how purely sexual love is terrible, and compares it to an empty cigarette carton. They then state that Mr. Brown holds that as the 'highest form of love...'. Nowhere does Mr. Brown use the word 'love' in this context. He says ""the premiere symbol of female sexuality"", not the ""highest form of love"". They are two VERY different things! This is a blatant attempt by the authors to twist the meaning of Mr. Brown's words to their own purposes!!! It is one of many I saw just in the first 38 pages of their book!I only got to page 123 before I had to stop reading. It was simply too painful for me. I feel I have an open mind to pretty much anything (I was once a 'born-again Christian', until I gained a healthy amount of common sense...), but these people are so closed-minded it's unrealistic! I cannot even finish this book. I'm just glad we didn't pay money for it (a friend gave it to my wife to read).Oh, and by the way, the vast (and I mean VAST) majority of the authors' arguments are based on letters written nearly 2000 years ago... letters they have absolutely no proof were EVER read by anyone at that time, and that could easily have been altered prior to publication... hmmmm, well by golly, if it's in writing then it must be true!!So, basically, if the Bible is factual, then there is no question as to the validity of the authors' allegations. But, the Bible was written by men, edited by men, men decided what would be included and what would be excluded... If you don't believe what's in the Bible, the whole point is moot. I, for one, do not...",negative
B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",3.0,Read Lutzer? Not as good,"I have not read the DaVinci Code written by Dan Brown. The other work on this subject I have read is titled the da Vinci Deception by Erwin Lutzer. Yes I am a Christian, so I am biassed against the DaVinci Code. This is my perspective about this book. Garlow and Jones gives a huge portion of space detailing how the Davinci Code advocates fornication as a way to accomplish a spiritual experience. Robert Langdom, The Davinci Codes main character, argues that Jesus advocated such a route to spiritual experience. This is a concept long advocated in many forms of Paganism. A concept clearly taught against in the Old Testament, therefore a concept that goes against the Hebrew Faith, traditional Christianity, and less Orthodox Christianity. Erwin Lutzer's book does not touch on this subject.Christians should seek out an understanding about the selection of books incorporated into the New Tesament. Christians should understand other ancient writings were not selected as scripture. Dan Brown tells a story incorporates historical artwork, alternative writings, and more contemporary scholarship in telling a story of a Robert Langdom discovering that the Jesus of the New Testament is a hoax. That in fact there is a real Jesus, but not devine. The alternative writings Dan Brown uses are from the Gnostic Gospels of Philip and Mary Magdaline. Jones and Garlow argue that Dan Brown theorizes that these works were written about 60 ad predating the works incorporated into the New Testament. Biblical scholars do not back up this claim.Jones and Garlow make the argument that the DaVinci Code is a distortion of Christian history and an attempt to confuse people about the authority and historic fact of the bible. To believe the arguments made by Robert Langdom, in the Novel, one would have to accept the idea the Apostle Paul, the Apostle Peter, and part of the other eleven Apostles were liars and betrayers of the teachings of Jesus. That a theology more consistent with the Roman and Greek paganism lost out to an argument against their already held beliefs. That people were tortured and died for an alternative teaching of Jesus.Garlow and James also point out that Marcion who sought out to make an alternative gospel that held no claims to Jesus' divinity or the supernatatural does claim, use, or acknowledge the existence of the gospels consistent with his arguments. Could it be that Marcion had no knowledge of these works. Marcion edited his own version of the Gospels around 170 ad a hundred years after what Robert Langdom claims the Gospel Mary Magdalen was written, but hundred years before what biblical scholars think the book was written.Yes Dan Brown clearly states that his book is fictional. The authors of the book make the argument that Dan Brown does want his readers to ponder the idea of a conspiracy of the Church to teach an alternative Gospel.Garlow and Jones make an argument for a certain type of evangelizing throughout their work. A fictional story line is used at the start of chapter to demonstrate this type of evangelizing. It is an argument for a personal relationship with your creator and how an alternative theology presented in Dan Browns work leaves you alone in this world. This is true but leaves out the fundamentals of Christianity: the inerrant of scripture, God's hatred of sin, man's inability to save himself, God being all knowledgeable, God being everywhere present- but not part of the creation, and salvation through Jesus Christ alone.",neutral

Between the two of them, they have authored 14 books (not fictious novels).2. Previous reviews are sharply divided. It has been my experience that some books are loved by everyone and some are hated by everyone, but the real thought-provoking books (such as The Da Vinci Code) also provoke great emotion and debate.3. In spite of the title this is not a book about Brown's novel, but about a rising challenge to traditional Christian theology behind the novel. Many people remind us, ""It's only a fictious novel!"", but after seeing the newer editions, teaching cds, and books tied to ""The Da Vinci Code"" the serious person must conclude that there is more.4. The book is designed for small group study. At the end of the book is a personal study guide and addresses to three web pages for further information.WARNING!This book is blatantly evangelistic with its message.

In particular Garlow and Jones disagree with Brown's description of the attitude of early church leaders towards women, sex and the divinity of Jesus Christ and especially Brown's suggestion of a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene which produced offspring.Garlow and Jones write in the style of two fundamentalists who feel threatened by a New Age heresy. They see a connection between the ideas expressed by THE DAVINCI CODE and the work of some of the scholars from The Jesus Seminar such as Elaine Pagels. Ultimately they predict the world will be divided into only two religious groups - pagan monism and biblical theism. The latter places God outside the circle of creation instead of in it as in pagan monism. In biblical theism God has a special place as creator apart from his creatures. In their view THE DAVINCI CODE preaches a form of pagan monism with God seen as an impersonal force of nature. Garlow and Jones stand firmly opposed to this view since they are on the side of the biblical theists.I don't think that Dan Brown is motivated by much more than a strong desire to tell a good story and sell a lot of books.

All these authors say is, bottom line, believe that Christianity is true-don't thnk any other way. This is not too bad, except that the way they try to prove it is so narrow in their appeal to mostly the Bible.Third, they really do not deal a lot at all with Da Vinci, his art, the Priory of Sion, and related issues (like the Knights Templar). You don't get the facts about these these or even any resources to help you look up stuff yourself.Making a buck. That's what this one is about, at least in my opinion. Check out the other books at amazon on this subject. Some are better than others. All seem to be better than this one (based on available reviews only).I'm going to order ""Breaking the Da Vinci Code"" (Bock) and ""The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code"" (Abanes).And FYI to all readers, I'm a Cat'lic (so maybe I'll pick up Kellmeyer, too, not sure).",negative
B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",5.0,The Best of Da Vinci Code Responses,"Christian apologists have been quick to respond to the historical inaccuracies taught in The Da Vinci Code. However, few have done much work on one of its central themes, ""the sacred feminine,"" which is deeply rooted in a pagan worldview. Pastor James Garlow and Dr. Peter Jones co-authored Cracking Da Vinci's Code to respond to the historical errors of Dan Brown's novel, as well as its paganism.Garlow and Jones begin with a chapter explaining why they wrote their book. ""Cracking Da Vinci's Code is for you if you have stopped to ponder Brown's `code' woven into his novel. It is for you if you are now questioning all you have learned about Jesus. We are writing for you if you are now saying, `I once thought of Jesus as the Son of God, but I guess I was wrong. He is simply a man after all.' For your sake, and His, we feel we must respond."" (23)The first issue addressed is Brown's characterization of sex and the Christian view of it. Garlow points out that, ""Sex is God's idea, and second to salvation, it's the best idea He ever shared with us."" (51) The authors go on to discuss the ""sacred feminine,"" Jesus, historical revisionism, the canon of scripture, the Gnostic gospels, secret knowledge, and pagan symbols. The conclude by showing that, ""Under the guise of a novel, The Da Vinci Code is an ideological call to arms."" According to them, it is a call to embrace pagan monism. They ultimately present to the reader a choice between paganism and Biblical theism.At the beginning of each chapter is a brief narrative about their own fictional character, Carrie Williams. Carrie is a practical agnostic who is attracted to the claims of The Da Vinci Code, but she's turned off by her extremely pagan roommate. In the middle of the book is a foldout color insert of The Last Supper, explaining its history and the figures in it. In the back is a reader's guide with four to five questions for each chapter to help facilitate reflection and discussion, as well as a spread of others books for further reading.Cracking Da Vinci's Code covers a wide range of issues, but hones in on the most important- the underlying worldview of pagan monism. The authors carefully explain each point and argument, showing the weaknesses of Brown's claims and worldview. The narrative about Carrie reminds us that the issues being dealt with are of practical and eternal importance. By the end of the book, James Garlow and Peter Jones have offered an excellent exposition of The Da Vinci Code as well as a clear and compelling case for the truth of biblical Christianity.",positive
B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",1.0,Denominational bias strikes again,"While reading this book if found it very poorly put together. The book is written by two authors with very few clues as to what was written by whom. Occasionally one of their first names will appear in parenthesis, but there is little clear delineation who wrote what. To simplify I'll just refer to them as he. Each chapter is prefaced by a progressive symbol of half a circle which he refers to as the Divine Arc next to a full circle which he doesn't refer to at all. Near the end of the book he gives a weak explanation of his symbolism, which is within a few pages of writing about paganism in which he devaluates the importance of symbols in religion. At the beginning of each chapter he has a ""after school special"" type drama for a couple of pages. He also repeats the points he wants to make twice at the beginning of each chapter. I found this annoying chapter after chapter. Though the ""after school special"" is supposed to be a college age drama, it is written so poorly I suspect that most college age people will gloss over it quickly.The body of the book is written trying to defend traditional Christianity from the evil of feminine paganism. His references to Da Vinci are actually very few. He presents the theory that Dan Brown is not writing a novel based on ""secret hints"" that can be found in Da Vinci's work, but that Mr. Brown is actually hoping to seduce our youth into ancient paganism. Paganism is generally pictured by modern people as hedonistic tribal affairs with lots of drinking, sex, and dancing in a circle around a fire. He tries to give an objective description of paganism but fails to point out that it is a very ancient and noble religion that predated Christianity, and probably Judaism. He doesn't mention that Aristotle and Plato were pagans. He puts comments about Da Vinci in column sidebars in each chapter. That means you have to stop reading the body of the chapter to read about Da Vinci. It makes for very choppy reading.Though he apparently intends the book to be used as a study guide, he leaves out an index. This makes it very difficult to look back for previous references. I see this as a very irresponsible deletion. As far as the body writing itself, it is apparent that it was written very quickly and with little overview. He misguides the reader into thinking he knows the true facts about history, however checking his footnotes reveals that ""facts"" should be substituted with ""opinions"". It leads me to believe that he is ""proof-texting"" history (the art of only choosing what reinforces your case) to build his case. The subtitle of this book is very misleading in that very little in ancient history can be proved now. Most ""facts"" from that period are still really theories. He really has it in for the Gnostics, and writes about them as though he went back in a time machine to observe them. It's apparent that his views are shaded by his religious background, and not really an objective historical observation. This is typical of denominational based authors.He takes some very risky shots at Hillary Clinton connecting her with Jean Houston implying that Hillary will be trying to bring the ""sacred feminine"" into the White House in the future. His source is a Time article about the book. It's ironic that he didn't mention Nancy Reagan and her astrologer. He views the ""sacred feminine"" as a threat to Christianity in general, however the Roman Catholics have revered ""the Virgin Mary"" for centuries. The main ""mystery"" of the Brown book is that Mary Magdalene had a closer relationship with Jesus than Christians are comfortable with. Da Vinci's painting of the Last Supper shows the apostles and Jesus lined up behind the table. Dan Brown points out that the person to Jesus' right (a position of great honor in Jewish tradition) is actually Mary Magdalene. Garlow (or Jones) points out that Da Vinci had specific notes about the painting and that the person to Jesus' right is an apostle. I've looked at pictures, posters, JPEG's, and the foldout that's in their book. Sorry guys, ""the dude looks like a lady.""It's of little importance to me what little pranks Da Vinci put into his art. Most brilliant creative minds play with their work. The Mona Lisa may be a disguised self-portrait of Da Vinci, a prank. It doesn't have to represent a diabolical subversive plot. It did make a very interesting novel. The Mason's have always been secretive, but the biggest secret is probably how much alcohol they consume each meeting.Garlow (or Jones) does make one very offensive reference to Da Vinci's mirror writing.""Da Vinci didn't do this in order to hide information or as part of some trickery or deceit; rather, he may have had some form of dyslexia or other difficulty with perception.""This statement alone causes me to really doubt this man (men's) intelligence. First, he's claiming he can read a genus's mind. Second, Da Vinci's writing was too neat to be a dyslexic's work. His comment reflects his own hidden agenda to ridicule his opposition with ""made up"" facts. He obviously can't out think them.My recommendation: Read ""The Da Vinci Code"" if you haven't already. It's a well-written book, and though it has snippets of little known history, its purpose is fiction. My recommendation on ""Cracking Da Vinci's Code"" is pass, and wait for the sequel ""Cracking-Cracking Da Vinci's Code.""And in ending the beginning of the book has a recommendation from our favorite facts man Tim LaHaye glorifying the book and accusing Dan Brown of ""outright lies."" This from a man who co-authored a series has made over 60 million dollars by fictionalizing Revelations. (Shouldn't the church be calling that series heresy?--a word Garlow/Jones like to use.)",negative

Digital Fortress and Deception Point are both about cracking some sort of codes. Nothing to do with religous codes just codes in general. And like those books, this book is FICTION. Hmm .. I wonder what his next book will be about.The authors of this book try to make you believe that Dan Brown is out to infect the world with some personal agenda and is using this medium to transport his theories. I can sum up very quickly what Dan Brown's motives were behind writing this book.- New York Time bestsellers sell tons of copies- Only the best and most engrossing books make the list- If I write a book about something I know (ie codes) and make it engrossing, I can rake in the cash too.There you have it, the whole point behind the book.

B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",2.0,Disappointing,"This book's argument can be summed up in a few easy premises: (1) Dan Brown is trying to pass off Gnosticism as real Christianity; (2) Gnosticism is bad, very bad; (3) Dan Brown is therefore very bad, mostly because he's one very effective part of a Gnostic revival that would threaten to undo the Christian Church in a post-modern world; (4) Don't fall prey to the deception -- accept Jesus and become a real Christian.The only thing even nearly original about this book is the insertion of a few details (and not even the most interesting ones) from The Da Vinci Code -- the rest is old hat, overly recycled arguments against anything that contradicts a fundamentalist reading of the Bible. They don't even begin to deal with the serious textual and historical issues raised by the Nag Hammadi texts, and they set up lots of straw men to knock down.In the end, the book will only convince the already-convinced, and with its preachy style will likely alienate the people the authors most would like, I assume, to reach. I expected more out of authors with these academic credentials.If you want a Christian book that handles the issues far more effectively, try Darrell Bock's Breaking the Da Vinci Code. Bock's book could have been more comprehensive, but addresses the questions in a vastly more intelligent manner that respects the reader. Garlow and Jones' effort falls way short of this.",negative

Instead I read a book which (a)did a fairly decent job of explaining Christian theology mixed in with (b) a cheesy narrative of one-diminsional stereotyped characters and (c) an obvious bias against anyone who did not follow the authors' prescribed beliefs. For example, every time the word &quot;feminist&quot; is used it is preceded by &quot;radical&quot;. Hilary Clinton is even mentioned because she is friends with a pagan! I am a deeply committed Christian and I found this book to be offensive. If the intent of the book is to evangalise, it will fail because of its shrill voice.

It is a very weak minded and preachy book written by authors who do not hide their prejudices. They needed to show better proof and be objective not supremely opinionated.

While this book may have some factual information to counter the Da Vinci Code (which, of course, is fiction), the language is clearly inundated with an emotional effort to preach against any non-fundamental Christian theology.If you are a conservative who felt your theology has been threatened and damaged by the Dan Brown novel, then this book may give you the warm and fuzzies that you need. On the other hand, there are many out there who are looking for good information sources to act as a catalyst for debate and discussion (regardless of viewpoint).

It's true that the canonical Gospels weren't written until mid to late 2nd century, but there were more than 100 gospels written.

(p. 118) First of all, the idea that she comes from Magdala is a theory to explain her name ""Magdalene"". There is nothing in the Bible about her coming from the city of Magdala. Second, Magdala was know as a fishing town, where fish were caught and processed. The city was not known for prostitution. There was a Babylonian cult that was active in Magdala (and elsewhere) and it was mistakenly associated with prostitution, but the city itself has no reputation for prostitution.""A number of scholars make an excellent case that the New Testament books were all written before A.D. 70."" (p. 105). Nonsense. No scholar in the past 50 years has advanced this idea. Besides, if the case was so ""excellent"" why do the authors on page 134 (cited above) claim that most scholars use late 2nd century as the date?I could go on, but why bother.

B000HOMU48,"Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts",1.0,Stay away from this book. These men are dangerous.,"This is without a doubt the worst book I have read in a very long time. Under the guise of helping the reader separate the fact from the fiction Garlow and Jones have created a hateful piece of propaganda. There are so many things wrong with Cracking, that I hardly know where to start. The writing is insulting, most if not all of the arguments are repetitive and have only circular logic, the authors skew history as much as they accuse Brown of doing, and in the end all that surfaces is a list of things the authors believe are bad. All the questions come from the ""how to craft leading questions to get the answers we want"" school of writing which is just insulting to even the most unsophisticated readers.Make no mistake where The da Vinci Code was a mediocre work of fiction, (for a better read try Eco's work) Cracking, is a Non-Fiction/Christian Living/Contemporary Issues work of poison. While the idea that people are reading The Code and taking it for fact, the idea that people are taking Cracking seriously is far more disturbing to me.Garlow and Jones make both open and thinly veiled attacks on everyone who is not them, and despite this list of people who are going to hell, I never could find just what exactly the authors thought was the Right/Christian way to live. Go figure. Weirdly enough, at least to me, the authors approve of Mel Gibson's Passion. One would think that the work was tinged enough with apocryphal and extra-Biblical work, along with the deathbed visions of German Nun Ann Catherine Emmerich to scare off Garlow and Jones' purist pretensions. Apparently not.Just in case you wonder the authors hate all the usual suspects gays, lesbians, ""feminists"" (which for reasons unknown is always written this way), pagans, Muslims, Jews and the Catholic Church, the occult, Women's study groups, premarital sex, and abortion. But there are some kind of surprises, they also hate smokers, drinkers, single moms, small families, birth control, anything Eastern that is therefore tinged with Paganism including yoga, chanting, music, meditation, women in the work force and out of the home, free thinking, liberals and liberal collages, anyone who disagrees with them, immodest dress on women, authors who write about subjects they disagree with including Shirley MacLaine, Sue Monk Kid, Elaine Pagels and Dominique Crosson, along with a whole host of other people, places, things and thoughts.There is a very negative message to this book that extends way beyond guiding readers away from Browns writings. The authors truly believe the reason we feel as thought something is broken is because something is broken. The reason we feel guilty is because we are guilty. (231) They think there is a very real spiritual war going on in America and that Christians are looking religious and political power to have things their way. (227) The authors also vehemently criticize what they call the Goddess bringing good news. In Garlow and Jones own words it is wrong to hope for or think that the Goddess will put our world together again. Humankind is wrong to think that She will unite ecological wisdom, economic justice, human rights, women's liberation, equality and harmony between the sexes, pan-sexual freedom, personal significance, global peace, religious unity, utopian dreams, life on our own terms, and deep spirituality. (222) They offer nothing as an alternative, not even a hearty read your Bible and see what you are missing.These men are dangerous. Not only do they believe that those who do not worship as they do are absolutely wrong, they are actively campaigning for others to believe the same way. With all their explaining, circle talking and insistence on ""The Truth"" Garlow and Jones do not ever clearly articulate what it is exactly that they believe. All the reader is left with is page after page of hateful, argumentative, ugly reasoning why everyone who is different is wrong.",negative

It is not polemic, preachy or in your face.As a candidate for the MFA degree in creative writing I can analyze both books with some professionalism. True my copy of the Code stated it was a novel. Better than the earlier Celestine Prophecy. The use of Code in the title immediately involves the reader into the success of the Bible Code by Michael Drosnin. Brown assimilated some of the press associated with this blockbuster.Brown used the 3rd person omniscience voice to tell his story, i.e., he goes inside the heads of his characters. This method is considered old fashioned by some. So what, he did it with verve. Also, he used aderbs...two in fact on the first page. Some say, ""Never trust an adverb."" I disagree, Psalm 139 says, I was fearfully and wonderfully made.""In Cracking we have two stories one fictional and the meat told in non-fiction. Bravo!

For example,their editors insisted on placing the excellant table of contents on the Internet...money saving device. Poor choice editors. This tactic detracts from non-fiction greatly. Spend money on the second edition.If one is rooting for the return of polytheistic paganism in full force, i.e, replacing all other religions, then ignore Garlow & Jones and put your faithin Brown.

See ""Cracking the Da Vinci Code ""","""Accurate scholarship can..."" says WH Auden in his famous poem...(Note: I do not reveal the DaVinci Code murder mystery end, but I tell a few other details about the OTHER mystery in Brown's The Da Vinci Code...)In 'Cracking DaVinci's Code', scholars Dr.James L. Garlow & and Dr. Peter Jones show that much of Brown's assertions about Christianity and some of his assertions about DaVinci are false or at best only partly true. Their book is a quick readable format.The DaVinci Code, a mega best seller, is touted by some reviewers as a great scholarly work also. But Drs. Jones & Garlow Disagree. Brown makes astounding claims about Christianity, specifically the divinity of Christ , His personal relationships, (I'm just hinting here) and of course Constantine & the Council of Nicea which (per Brown) pulled a scam on the world which has fooled 99% of Christians for the past almost 2000 years, till now. And (miraculously) the ""real"" religion is exactly what some want today, and what is being marketed in some colleges, etc.---a goddess based religion.If Brown is right, his message deserves to get out. But how do we test his assertions? My hint above: ""Accurate scholarship... which--if applied-- (to paraphrase Auden) can help us discover how a culture went wild..."" or how & where Brown went wild.Brown makes several claims that his research is factual. And you will find some reviewers (notably the NY Times) lavishing him with so many superlatives one wonders if any adjectives of praise were left unused. Maybe his mom wrote the review!!! (Just kidding!)His mystery story is interesting (makes me want to visit the Louvre, for instance!!!) but compared to Grisham's mystery The Firm, it still took me a few pages to get interested.But read Garlow/Jones after DaVinci Code if you think that truth is something that can be checked.But if you **want** to make up your own truth, and you like the world described in ""Davinci Code"" **don't** read Garlow/Jones' Cracking the DaVinci Code ...BECAUSE....As a great woman scholar, Dorothy L.

Yeah- score one for accurately portraying reality (sarcasm for those who don't get it). As I said- they slame DB for making stuff up, but in reality that isn't actually something they have a problem with themselves. Two men who obviously know nothing of feminists and here they are teaching others. Sorry guys- it's silly pontificating like this that proves you have no respect for facts yourselves.As one can guess, this book isn't going to convince anyone who actually enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, and thought that the concepts DB discussed were interesting and worth researching, that DB was wrong. But, it will convince those who hated the book and were troubled by it all along that he was wrong. So- expect lots of believers to cite this book as proof that TDC is not true. Unfortunately, the writers of this book were not held to the high standards they seem to expect fiction writers to adhere to.

Whats worse, they introduce this girl named Carrie in their book who is having ""sexual"" problems with her ""typical"" male boyfriend. The book immeadiatly begins reading like a young Christian adult book. They state that Mr. Brown has an agenda...I think they too have an agenda.I am a practicing Catholic and am aware that DaVinci Code is fiction and based on very limp evidence. There is very little to suggesr that Jesus had a child with Mary Magdalene. However, this book immeadiately takes a stance and looks for evidence to back it up rather than drawing a conclusion from research. It's POOR scholarly writing, and that is what is so upsetting about it. In your quest to learn more about the life of Christ, make sure you examine all facts and draw your conclusions from it.

They do not succeed in discrediting Brown's novel, rather, they are closer to strengthening it. Their primary source of contention to Brown's work is the Bible, which they present as a historical document. There may or may not be some historical value to the Bible, but they are arguing that there is no basis for Brown's postition that the Bible was contrived by the Church as a method of propagating their own power. The problem with this is that they cannot offer any proof that what Brown contends is anything but the truth. It is true that Brown offers no concrete data to support his claim about the Bible, but they can neither offer any concrete evidence that the Bible is historical fact. The problem with this book is that it is written by two fundamentalists who have no more evidence than the man they are trying to discredit. Frankly I think that Dan Brown and James Garlow and Peter Jones need to all sit down and argue this with each other, because they are both simply preaching to those who want to listen. This is nothing more than a religious difference of opinion, and since they both claim to be using ""Historical Fact,"" obviously one of them has to be wrong, but this book does not offer a way to decide which it is. Simply put, while the authors do offer a small amount of concrete data, it is nothing that someone with an internet connection could not find out for himself in a matter of a couple of hours; this book does not do all that it sets out to do.",negative

It is written from a Christian perspective, which is exactly what the negative &quot;reviewers&quot; don't like.

It is not a scholarly work. It is not intended to be a scholarly work. It is written for the masses, especially those not educated in things of the Bible, or much else.

B0007E8TUW,"1918, the last act (Ballantine U6017)",5.0,"When the ""Glory"" had long gone...","This book was written in the `60's, and there were immediate comparisons, rightly in my opinion, with Barbara Tuchman'sThe Guns of August. The two books serve as ""bookends"" for the First World War. Tuchman's covers the first month of the war, August, 1914, when it was a war of movement, and there were possibilities for a quick ending. ""Glory"" was much on the minds of the elites of Europe, as well as the men who fought for them. By 1918, the Glory had long gone, save for some new arrivals from across the Atlantic. As Pitt states, that was one of the two major developments that changed the dynamics, and possible ""winners"" of the war, and once again the outcome was as finely balanced as it was in 1914. Due to the Russian revolution, and the withdrawal of their troops from the Eastern Front, this gave the Germans the opportunity to transfer their troops from the East, and throw everything they had at the Western Front, in the hopes of beating the English and French before the arrival of the Americans in substantial numbers. The author tells the drama of this story well.Pitt sets the stage for the final year, aptly describing the immense gulf that existed between the officers and men who were fighting. Consider: ""By this time, it was the Staff who were regarded by the British front-line soldier as his main enemy (a not uncommon development in any army) and for them he nursed a bitter hatred and an undying contempt...The fault lay basically in the peacetime structure of the Army, in which the officers were separated from the other ranks by an impassable social and mental barrier."" Included in the book are numerous black and white pictures I had not seen before. The first two dramatic underscore this gulf. The first shows some field officers looking down into a ""model"" trench, all properly sandbagged, with six rows at the top. The second shows the awful reality of the mud holes that serve as a trench at Passchendaele.The author writes well, and contrasts the state of the British and French armies with the Americans who had just arrived: ""Five yards apart, in four ranks, twenty yards between each rank, the marines advanced. Nothing had been seen like it, in mass innocence, in hope and at the end in unavailing heroism and self-sacrifice, since the British attack on the Somme in 1916--it is quite possible that the lack of immediate reaction from the enemy was due to disbelief that in 1918 such naivet&eacute; could still exist."" He then goes on to describe the carnage as the American Marines were mowed down.Pitt has a deep understanding of war, and can equally describe the thinking at the General Staff level, as well the privates in the trenches. Concerning another tough fight, by the American 2nd Division, at Belleau Woods, Pitt says: ""By evening many of the companies were commanded by sergeants, a breed quicker to jettison Staff theories than are those holding commissioned rank.""Pitt is British, and reserved his harshest criticism for their military leaders. His epilogue and aftermath is rich in anecdotes that should be long remembered. Apocryphal, or not, he has the following unattributed quote: ""'Thank Heavens the war is over is over', one of them is reputed to have said'...now we can get back to real soldiering.'"" And in terms of learning anything, in preparation for the next war, Pitt says that ""...as late as 1940 a candidate for a war-time commission was asked by the interviewing board at Cambridge three questions--and three only: What school did he attend? What was his father's income? Did he ride a horse?""A solid military history, with excellent maps, by one who understood, and depicted all the madness of that war as it truly was. 5-stars.",positive
B0007E8TUW,"1918, the last act (Ballantine U6017)",4.0,looks good at 48,"Since 1962, a great deal of scholarly research has been done on the Western Front in World War I. This has involved the search of primary archives, unpublished memoirs and detailed technical and topographic research. Yet the conclusions reached by Barrie Pitt that, 1) By 1918 the contending armies had, each in their own way, worked out how to overcome and breakthrough the entrenched defences of the time 2) none of the armies had the operational ability to create sustained offensive drives like those seen some twenty years later 3) by the fall of 1918 the German Army was being unwillingly and systematically driven out of the territory it had occupied since 1914 yet it still had some level of relative military effectiveness, hold up well to the light of the most modern work.Barrie Pitt's work is distinguished by a continued tone of moral outrage at the level of human carnage inflicted by the two sides on each other and his attempts to balance considerations of high level politics with the awful reality on the ground. He does not appear to disagree with modern scholars that dedicated and intelligent men on each side did a great deal to work out their battlefield problems in a rational and thoughful way. He just seems to remember 10 million reasons they cannnot be said to have been highly successful.The book has a useful number of clear large scale maps and a good section of photographs which are not so directly connected with the text. As suggested, this is not a scholarly book with footnotes and so on and seventy secondary works are cited in the bibliography including seven by B H Lidell Hart the once famous and now maligned military critic.The reasons this book gets only four stars is that it is really about the Western Front only and in many cases you have to accept the author's judgements without a lot of facts to back them up. For example, he talks at some length about the significance of the Allied blockade in undermining Germany's power to resist but there are not any numbers for those of us who look back from the distance of ninety years.",positive

Impregnable from the sea, Singapore collapsed before a Japanese force fighting its way through the 'impenetrable' jungle of the Malay Peninsula. Only at the last moment did the civilians on Singapore realize the danger they were in. And then they'd do anything to get out.This novel features two of Reeman's standard characters: the crusty, traditional, martinet career Royal Navy officer, and the young R.N. reserve officer, unpolished but skilled, and increasingly experienced as the war progresses. As is common in many Reeman novels, the tension between these two men drives much of the story in the early part of the book, until they both realize that, as another hero of the era might have put it, the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. By the time they figure that out, they've got bigger problems, like how to make it out alive.As noted, this novel has many of the things that cause some people to call Reeman's novels 'formulaic.' But I think it's a darn good formula, personally, and Reeman is a good enough story teller that even if some of the characters seem vaguely familiar, the story itself still draws you in and keeps you reading.",neutral

2921801086,Clara Gutsche: The Convent Series,5.0,Cloistered Nuns Photo Album,"""THE CONVENT SERIES"" is a collection of 90 beautiful photographs taken by the famed photographer, Clara Gutsche. The photos in this oversized 85-page soft covered book offer an unprecedented study of the ""intimate spaces"" and the monastic life of cloistered nuns in Quebec. Working inside convents throughout the province of Quebec, Gutsche allows viewers a rare and sensitive glimpse into these guarded religious communities. Approximately twenty-five convents, most of them cloistered, opened their doors to the photographer and her camera. Gutsche depicts a structured, female world devoted to prayer and contemplation. The artist's examination of her subject is distant and yet, at the same time, highly emphatic. The overall effect of her project is remarkable in its rich combination of detail, intensity, subtle humor and intimacy. From the Foreword: ""Rarely have we seen a camera approach a world so silent, and render images so evocative and full of meaning.The instrument that crosses the threshold of these convents is just a camera. The vision behind it, however, is that of an artist motivated by a keen sense of history and the social relationships that fuel it."" The privacy, control, and isolation found in one's home are many timesa99 magnified in the context of cloistered nuns, whose vows have led to a secluded life of simple domesticity and intense spirituality. ""THE CONVENT SERIES"" is a landmark record of convent life and provides insight into a changing and disappearing world.

0520234960,The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era,5.0,Human Rights and Indigenous Peoples,"Human rights are rights considered to be held by individuals simply because they are part of the human species. They are rights, in essence, shared equally by everyone regardless of sex, race, nationality, or ethnic background. They are universal in content. Despite this fairly straight forward definition, the recognition of human rights by individuals, groups, societies, states, and nations has been a constant battle across both space and time. Throughout the centuries groups or societies have failed to recognize certain human rights of individuals, groups, and cultures while at the same time recognizing those of others. Likewise, conflicting political traditions have elaborated different components of human rights or differed over which elements had priority. Today, the manifold meanings of human rights embodied in this definition reflects this process of history and change.Presenting this long and conflicted history in one of the more accessible and comprehensive editions to date, The History of Human Rights by Micheline R. Ishay is the authoritative text on the subject. Using the main points developed in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the book chronicles the clashes of ideas, social movements, and armies that comprise the history of human rights. This history, although largely told from a Western perspective does encompass the perspective of those who have struggled to obtain them. Framing the history of human rights development through six core arguments, The History of Human Rights offers not only a comprehensive history and analysis, but also the basis for a discussion of where human rights needs to progress. This last component is what gives this book particular importance for indigenous peoples. As lucidly covered through six in-depth chapters, one of the final battles in the history of human rights will be over the rights of cultures, and particularly the inherent rights of indigenous peoples and their cultural lifeways in relation to state, national, and international rights.Beginning with the controversy of human rights and religion, Ishay argues that each great religion contains important humanistic elements which have contributed to our modern conceptions of rights. For example, in the West, the impact of Judeo-Christian morality and ethics has been central to the development of human rights. As Ishay notes Judeo-Christian morality was secularized, separated from politics, and strengthened in influence by the advent of capitalism and colonialism in Europe, largely at the expense of other notions of ethics. Because of the development of capitalism in Europe, Judeo-Christian ethics became secularized with the progress of the Reformation (16th century) and the democratic revolutions of the eighteenth century, finally being transformed into a liberal discourse that dominates our current conception of human rights.This leads to Ishay's second major argument in The History of Human Rights: that our modern conception of rights, wherever in the world they may be currently voiced, are predominantly European in origin. Not only are they largely founded on a secularized version of Judeo-Christian ethics, but that their current definition largely originated out of this European beginning. As Ishay correctly argues, this does not imply that Western rights are reducible to contemporary free-market liberalism, but rather that the human rights vision currently depicted as liberal is in fact indelibly molded by the socialist ideals that grew out of nineteenth-century European industrialization and secularized Judeo-Christian ethics.As Ishay clearly articulates, the two documents most responsible for modern legal formulations of human rights are the American Bill of Rights and the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Both of these documents were the result of various social movements in the pre-industrial era. When industrialization took over in Europe and America, becoming an all consuming process, these documents coupled with the previously secularized Judeo-Christian ethical thought became the guiding ideologies in human rights definitions.As such, our modern liberal take on human rights is also indebted to the social thought of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Ishay's third argument). Current attempts at asserting universal human rights, as The History of Human Rights argues, are defensive mechanisms against either liberal or socialist ideologies, since these ideologies presumably represent the oppressive legacy of Western imperial and colonial domination of the world.The fourth argument in The History of Human Rights builds on the previous three, as the progress of human rights moved from individual to social, and finally cultural in scope. As such, Ishay contends that cultural rights must always be informed by, and checked against, a universalist perspective of human rights.Like religious rights, the notion of cultural rights, so strongly advocated by liberal nationalists in nineteenth-century Europe (and later championed during the twentieth-century post-colonial struggle) was largely rejected by socialists because it caused a disjunction between group solidarity and universal human rights (p. 131). Challenging liberal ambiguities, many socialists pointed out that the primary beneficiaries of cultural rights were more often particular groups or individuals within the culture, and not the culture as a cohesive whole.If we cannot trace the history and development of human rights in a linear fashion of progression from the individual to the social to the cultural, how can we say there has been any progress made in their development? This is Ishay's fifth argument: has there been any progress through history towards a universal set of human rights. Her contention is that there has been, although not necessarily through the recognized mechanisms. This in spite of President Roosevelt's 1945 proclamation that the United Nations would ""spell the end of the system of unilateral action, ... the balances of power, and all the expedients that have been tried for centuries - and have always failed"" (Roosevelt 1950: 570).In short, universal human rights are always potentially endangered by particularist and vague conceptions of rights framed in terms of the ""national interest,"" ""national security,"" the right to ""individual self-determination,"" or ""cultural rights."" Therefore, we must constantly keep vigilance on those who are in power and those who define human rights and their scope. This last point leads to The History of Human Rights' final point; a question rather then an argument.Is globalization a boon or a threat from a human rights perspective. This is an especially important question when looking at the human rights progress in terms of indigenous peoples. As Ishay argues, and I would agree, the answer is that globalization has the potential to be a boon for human rights, but that we are not there yet. With the development of global information technology, Human Rights Peacenet, Indigenous Peoples Issues and Resources, Amnesty International, and a multitude of other websites human rights advocates now have unprecedented possibilities for fighting. One cannot overlook the success of the human rights community's ""infopressure"" on the Mexican government during the Chiapas rebellion or the human rights ""infoactivity"" during the turbulent events in Tiananmen Square or against Indonesia's repression in East Timor.However, we have not reached a nadir, we are still fighting an uphill battle. Not only has globalization opened new networks and avenues, but it has also allowed unprecedented human rights violations to occur. The illegal war in Iraq, China's occupation of Tibet, and the taking of land and natural resources from indigenous peoples are just a few. Human rights are still not universal. The best way to fight for their universal application is to know their history. The History of Human Rights is the best place to start. By knowing where we have come from, and how we got here, we can positively move forward. The History of Human Rights should be on everyone's reading list.Make a difference. Know the history.

0394715195,The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property,1.0,The excerpt alone is full of faulty reasoning.,"In the excerpt we are immediately asked to imagine a scene where a boorish colonist mistakes an Indian loan for an Indian gift. In the scene it is noted that when the Englishman receives this gift he immediately says to himself, &quot;What a nice thing to send back to the British Museum!&quot;. When the Indians later demand to know where their gift is, the Englishman is so astounded they would voice this demand he invented the term, &quot;Indian giver&quot; to ridicule it. We are then given the author's definition of gift as a gift that keeps on giving.. i.e. the gift doesn't stop with the receiver but must be passed on to keep it true; &quot;whatever we have been given is supposed to be given away again, not kept.&quot; Except we learn in the next paragraph that actually the material gift is not important if it is replaced with another gift of equal or greater value. He even goes on to state that the gift need not be returned to the original donor but can be passed along to another member of society. Well, isn't that what the Englishman intended to do upon first receiving it? What we are actually witnessing is a clash of presuppostions based on two parties coming from completely different methodolgies of trade and social discourse. What gifting is to the Englishman is always an expression of gratitude or good will with no strings attached. What gifting is to the barter-centered Indian is the exact opposite.The Indians were not giving anything away but their trust. Under a barter economy transactions are conducted in goods with gifts given as a prelude to NEGOTIATION. The Indians were not being generous with their goods but were instead being generous with their credit! Under a barter economy how do you suppose a new-comer would be greeted? Remember there is no currency, only capital. Well, if you are a savvy trader you will attempt to determine your new neighbor's credit worthiness by offering something of value and then waiting for the return. If the object itself is returned it means the newcomer is relatively poor and has nothing of equal value. If something of relatively equal value is returned then a certain equity can be assumed. If something of greater value is returned then the tables have been turned and negotiations can continue untill all parties are comfortable with each other, i.e. each has gotten to know one another via this custom. The fact is, under this system nothing is given freely. It is understood by all that this is all negotiation. Polite negotiation. The Englishman walks into this world from a completely different background. His economy is revolving not around constant negotiation with everybody he meets. Things are much more regulated. The art of negotiation is lost on him.The Englishman's immediate desire to give the pipe to a museum completely undermines the author's contention that the Englishman wanted to keep it for himself. The Englishman actually is more in tune with the author's description of a gift than the Indians. What actually is happening here is the exact opposite of what the author wants us to believe. The Englishman will give the gift to a British museum where he will in effect be circulating this gift throughout the world. The Indians want it back or something back to communicate to them the newcomers relative wealth and hence further credit worthiness. It can be assumed that the Englishman is also working under similar ideologies but under a more protracted and sophisticated methology. He is giving to a museum from which he has taken in the past free of charge. He is returning to the museum an obligation he feels which is the same obligation the author is describing as existing only in the Indian world. But wait a second. It seems that this exchange is simply a protracted settling of accounts between the colonist and the museum. It is the same settling of accounts the Indians expected but to which the Englishman simply transferred to his own set of books which actually preffered to assume all gifts were eventually to be repaid without ever the contention that it would be otherwise. The Indians simply had a much more LOCAL and IMMEDIATE need for retribution. The term &quot;Indian giver&quot; can be seen an accurate description of a type of gift that contains an immediate retribution. As opposed to gifts within a monied economy where barter has been replaced with retail, gifting has simply become less important as a means of character assessment. In a monied economy, the entire barter system is replaced with a much more convenient marketplace. The disparity between the two views of gifts has nothing to do with framing the colonists or the Indians as being more or less generous but instead has everything to do with simple misunderstanding. Misunderstanding that may have been reconcilable if the colonists had not been so eager to view the Indian as anything more than savage.",negative
0394715195,The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property,5.0,In the face of the je ne sais quoi.,"Years ago there was a reader comment in Harper's Magazine to the effect that the spirit of a place is a residue of emotions from the person who cared for it. Examples were the backseat of a taxicab and a favorite aunt's guest bedroom. Imagine the one, a robotic garage worker, mindlessly vacuuming and swabbing, and now Aunt Sally in a sunny kitchen starching linens and putting flowers in a vase.The reader was attempting to pinpoint a distinction of spirit that we recognize but can't define. Lewis Hyde confronts this problem as he tries to explain the difference between schlock and art. It is the dilemma that so vexed Potter Stewart as he tried to define pornography-""I know it when I see it, but I can't say what it is."" Like Potter Stewart, Hyde can give examples, but no explanation. Hyde, however, is too game for surrender in the face of the ineffable.Hyde starts with a hypothesis: Art acquires a spiritual quality that comes from a giving heart, And a corollary: The spiritual quality of art is lost if disrespected by the recipient. Hyde hypothesizes that the artist, recipient of an unearned talent from a giving god, must share it in turn with a giving heart. (Does this mean art cannot be sold? Oops, we're getting ahead ... .)In seven chapters, two questions predominate: What is the spiritual quality that differentiates gifts from non-gifts (""commodities"" in Hyde's parlance)? And, what is the nature of the disrespect that will so profane the gift as to nullify it? Here are some of his suggestions.Gifts are not-as some suppose-without strings. (Forget flowers or a `thank you' to Aunt Sally, you'll see.) Rather, gifts and commodities differ because gifts are ambiguous and variable as to value. First, gifts and their reciprocals may not be equivalent in price, but it is bad manners to compare. (One does not ""look a gift horse in the mouth."" Right? ""It is the thought that counts."" Right? See, you already know this stuff.) And second, although the price of a gift may be low, the ""thought that counts"" (the spirit of the gift) causes a gift to increase in value as it is passed along. Aunt Sally gives you a frayed scrap of lace your grandmother and she both wore at their weddings. It is tattered, yet, from one generation to the next, each exchange has enhanced its value. Later, you send fudge to Aunt Sally. She invites friends to share and brags about your thoughtfulness. Lousy stale resort fudge, it may be awful, but it is bad manners to say so. It is the fact that these tokens came as gifts that gives them value.Ambiguity and variability mean gifts, literally, do ""keep on giving"". In a commodity exchange, I trade corn, you trade tomatoes, we agree on equivalent values, we exchange, we are quit. In a gift exchange inequivalencies of price together with increases in value leave a residuum, an indefiniteness of obligation that binds both parties to future transactions. We have not balanced our account; we are not quit. We have a continuing duty to make future exchanges to extend the longer-term relationship.Reciprocity creates gift circles. Where the circle is greater than two, a gift to one is a proxy gift to all. Thus, when Aunt Sally invites you to stay, she may not think her son will one day come stay with you, but when he does, your gift to him is a reciprocal gift to Aunt Sally as well. Every gift enhances the bonds with all whom we perceive to be within the circle.Disrespect of a gift weakens our sense of community with the one who disrespects it. This is true on the level of mundane-when Uncle Henry skips family Christmas for a cruise with country club friends-and the sublime-when we perceive that others devalue divine gifts. For instance, why is society uncomfortable with sales of kidneys? Why is society uncomfortable with slavery? Do sales of people and parts profane what others believe to be a gift? Why is post-modern society so uncomfortable with pornography and prostitution? Does commercialization profane something that many believe is a gift between partners? Why are emotions so high in the debates on abortion, euthanasia and the death penalty? Do the objectors believe these actions profane a gift?Hyde uses the themes from the first seven chapters to devise a theory of literary criticism that he applies to Walt Whitman and Ezra Pound. Like some of the other reviewers, I did not feel that the theory's application was as engaging as its development. It seems to work better with Whitman. This is in part because Whitman's effusive spirituality lends itself to discussions of the artist as medium, but I may also be influenced by the fact that I am stingier with appreciation of Pound. Hyde, himself, admits that by the time he has completed his proofs he is no longer as convinced of his premise as he was at the outset. He acknowledges that art may be sold in some circumstances and does not always become profaned thereby.Though the theory's application is perhaps not successful in the way Hyde hoped it would be, still, the book is a stunning work. It succeeds in so many ways that a copy (with marginal notes) resides permanently on the topmost select shelf in my non-lending library. I keep copies on hand to give to friends.Frankly, first time through, this book was difficult. Hyde is a poet, first and after all, and each paragraph is dense with meaning, so I read it in small bites with careful digestion in between. He uses words (`erotic' and `copulative' come to mind) in ways that are so far removed from modern usage as to be confusing at first. But take the time; make the effort. This book is a gift to all of us. It would be churlish not to appreciate it.",positive

The book focuses on the importance of gift, the flow and movement of gift, and the impact that the modern market place has had on the circle of gift.From the opening pages when Hyde amuzingly discloses the premise of gift by juxtaposing the Indian Giver with White Man Keeper, the book progresses gift through community, folktale and art.If you have ever been dismayed by the modern or postmodern. If you have ever wanted to make your money, cash out and leave the madness, you should read this book. Not only does it give you hope, it may rejunvenate your idea of community.Gift is a tremendous piece of scholarship and for it to lay, largely undiscovered, is a shame indeed.",positive

I cannot say that about 90% of the books I have read.I believe it is a good example of &quot;history of ideas&quot; literature. It is a deconstruction of the notion of economics and commerce. By focusing on the narrow subject of gift giving, it opens the window to a critical understanding of common ideas like ""interest,"" ""usury,"" and ""economic community."" After all, what makes up a global economy? How do people bind themselves to ""beliefs"" that enable cooperation.The book is not prescriptive. Instead, it is provocative to the extent that it challenges assumptions. I recommend it to the reader who is looking for an intellectual escape into the historically possible.",positive

Any student of the social sciences becomes aware that there are many important exchanges made in society which are not and cannot be valued in market transactions. Hyde offers a thoughtful analysis of the social function of goods and services exchanged outside the structure of the market. These arguments are essential as a counterbalance to the positivism expressed in most economic thought today.A good deal of the material from which Hyde draws can be found in Marcel Mauss's book, also called in English, *The Gift* (Essai sur le don).

0394715195,The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property,3.0,Inspiring and full of life,"I read this book on the recommendation of a dear friend of mine, and after reading it i can understand why she recommended it. This philosophic and poetic book deals with a very important facet of human lives and societies that is all too often overlooked in economic analyis, namely the act of giving where no market is involved. This book is not your usual and often too facile critique of the market economy. The latter gets its proper due but not only in a negative sense; after all, market economic systems generate goods and choices in a particular area of scarcity in more efficient ways than tried out on other systems. Yes, it is certainly true, as the author points out, that the social act and economics of the commodity exchange is something else entirely than the social act of giving outside of the market economy, and both the analyis and implications in the book make that deservedly clear. As an economist i found the discussion on usury and the different categories of values that can be atttached to a product very interesting and basic. At the same time, I had not yet encountered such an interesting discussion on the act of giving as part of a society and the linkages with a commodity producing market economy. And as a person taking part of society I found the discussion on the creative act of giving and the trace of social bonds this engenders inspiring on a personal level as well. The writer here mixes analysis with what is for me enlightening poetic language, and the role of the artist here is also well put. As other reviewers, I found the first part very interesting while the further discussion on Whitman and Pound was harder going. Although certainly not always an easy read as a scholarly study, I can certainly recommend this unusual book on the abundance and generosity of spirit that living in society can bring, as a conscious act with magic of inspiration.",neutral
0394715195,The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property,3.0,Heart in the right place,"Lewis Hyde is, I am certain, an excellent Humanities professor. I have nothing at all against professors of Humanities - on the contrary, I believe that every university should have one. The problem with this effort is that he slips into areas where he not only has no expertise, but even worse - it seems that he does not realize that he has none. For example, one could almost call this book an economics text, in that he profers theories of economics throughout; specifically, ""gift economies"" vs ""market economies"". The problem is, there are no ""gift economies"" in the world, and never have been. The examples he uses, such as the Kula of New Guinea, have a very elaborate traditional gifting ritual, but Hyde does not seem to understand that this is wholly separate from their economy, which stands apart from the gifting practices. The gifts of shells that are passed around the ranking Kula males have nothing at all to do with their living; it is a social ritual. The Kula have other methods of providing food, shelter and clothing for their people, and it has no connection with their gifting practices.In this book, Hyde ventures into many areas outside of his field of expertise: economics, sociology, secular and religious history, political science, and more. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but he demonstrates woeful deficiencies in these areas. For example, he bemoans the conclusions drawn by Martin Luther and others in the sixteenth century that allowed ""usury"" to become common practice. (By this, he means the charging of interest of any amount on loans.) This, he explains, ripped the world out of a golden age of free thinking, creativity, and gifting, into a deadly era of logic, commodity trading and profit. This golden age of gifting whose passing he mourns is more commonly referred to as ""the dark ages"" for very good reason. During this time, there was no ""usury"" in the form of common banking systems as we now know them, it is true. There was also nearly universal illiteracy, no hope for improvement of ones birth-lot, constant epidemics, witch-burnings, inquisitions, etc.After this unthinkable introduction of ""usury"", the world was transformed, but not at all according to Hyde's dolorous version of history. The Renaissance, according to Hyde, was a calamitous step backward. Yet, within a century, witch burnings were a lamented legacy of a bygone era; education for the masses was becoming a reality; medical advances were beginning to chip away at the terrible mortality rates; social consciousness was rearing its head - people were beginning to ask hard questions of the ruling classes. Hyde doesn't see any of this as genuine progress.As other reviewers have pointed out, Hyde conflates two entirely different definitions of the term ""gift"" and thus leaves this work in a hopeless muddle. A ""gift"" in the sense of a freely given item bestowed upon one person or group by another person or group, is not at all the same thing as the the concept of divinely bestowed talents for creativity. We call the artists among us gifted, in the sense that it was once believed that the Gods had provided this ability to create, and thus the artist had received a ""gift"". This superstition provides Hyde with the entree to extend his economic theories of gifting to the sphere of creativity, when in fact, there is no connection between the two.I give the work three stars because the last two chapters - pertaining to Whitman and Pound - provide excellent insights into the forces that shaped these two poets into the artists that they were. This is Hyde's field, and he clearly has some deep insights into the inner workings of the minds of these two geniuses. This alone is worth the price of the book and the time to read it.Of course, one must ignore his attempts to draw conclusions from this analysis in the world at large, but that is easily done, because he himself admits that he was wrong, in his conclusion. He doesn't go quite far enough, I must say, but it's very strange to read an entire book, and then see the author's concluding chapter where he says, ""I was wrong"". Unfortunately, he admits only partial error - not enough to rewrite the entire tome. This is sad to me, because I get the sense from this book that Hyde had some very profound insights into the nature of gifts. Had he not felt compelled to muddy the waters by bringing in his amateurish economic theories, and then totally departing into irrelevancies by conflating giftedness with gifting - we could have had quite a ""gift"" here. As it is, it will impress a few who do not care to think too deeply about what the author is actually saying. The rest will dig for the few pearls buried in the dross, and shake their heads at the rest.",neutral

0394715195,The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property,2.0,Stretched too thin,"A colleague, influenced by reading this book years ago, posted a recommendation, and as I am interested in the Sociology of Art and being a for-profit composer, I thought it might be pertinent.Unfortunately, this book reminds me of that old joke, that there are two kinds of people in this world - those who believe there are two kinds of people in this world, and those who don't.In his general criticism of the limits of Capitalism, Mr. Hyde says things that will warm the hearts of any liberal. For example, &quot;There is a place for volunteer labor, for mutual aid, for in-house work, for healings that require sympathetic contact or a cohesive support group, for strengthening the bonds of kinship, for intellectual community, for creative idleness, for the slow maturation of talent, for the creation and preservation and dissemination of culture, and so on.&quot; It's a great sentence, and deserves mulling. Compare that with this later nonsense: &quot;We have, on the one hand, imagination, synthetic thought, gift exchange, use value, and gift-increase, all of which are linked by a common element of eros, or relationship, binding, 'shaping into one.' And we have, on the other hand, analytic or dialectical thought, self-reflection, logic, market exchange, exchange value, and interest on loans, all of which share a touch of logos, of differentiating into parts.&quot;Must Mr. Hyde equivalence everything? Must everything that the marketplace has difficulty in valuing be called a &quot;gift&quot;? Must the world be broken into Capitalism and gifts? How about Capitalism and lots of things not covered by Capitalism? And he definitely needs to read some Buber.As a poet, Mr. Hyde should understand the difference between saying that a person is &quot;gifted&quot;; i.e., has received a gift FROM GOD, and whether the work done is a &quot;gift&quot; to others. It's as if the entire first half of his book is based around a coincidental quirk of colloquial English - definition one and two in the dictionary.It's a shame, because in the last three chapters, Hyde writes about what he really wants to: Whitman's homosexuality, and Pound's politics. Unfortunately, Hyde confuses his approval of the former (which led to the care of Civil War casualties) and condemnation of the latter (which led to anti-Semitic tirades) with judgements of the worth of each's poetry during these times. It's a weak thesis, and bears little relation to all the &quot;gift&quot; theory in the beginning, which suffers from the same Jungian equivalence syndrome (all fairy tales are the same, blah, blah, blah).And then, in the last chapter, he throws away the theory and writes a conclusion which is observant, in its way.So there's much good in this book, but it's mixed in with so much bad (the soul, spirit, greatness - the usual hack work), that it's not worth a thorough read. And he completely ignores Warhol, conceptualism, performance art - all kinds of recent challenges to the old theory of &quot;art&quot; that in 1979-83 he should have been fully aware of.",negative

(A complex person, a good man in a bad situation)Seriously, although it is rarely mentioned, I was struck by the Biblical and religious references and overtones of this book. Charlotte Bronte, as a clergyman's daughter, sure knew the Bible. And contrary to popular opinion, religious people understand the trials of temptation, perhaps more than most. That is why Jane's struggles with her desires ring true. Although she suffered, her self-respect remained intact.

But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read is a set with selected works of all the Bronte sisters, so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them.Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so.",positive

The beginning part of the book is reminiscent of Dickens since Jane survives a horrible childhood of mistreatment. And when she meets Mr. Rochester and against all odds he falls in love with her (for her character and intelligence as she is ""plain and poor"") the book really gets interesting for most of its fans.

While it does have the Dickens-esque feel of sometimes seeming to drag on much longer than necessary, in the end everything comes together in a satisfying way.While it's not the type of book to keep you up at night wondering what will happen next, it also isn't one to make you wonder why you are continuing at all.

Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes.

She teaches a young French girl, and gradually falls in love with the master of the house, but the love is that sort of ""forbidden love."" Jane struggles with this love and her low position in life. It's a classic, beautiful romance novel, full of love, and the complications in love. I've read many Victorian romance novels, but this one tops them all. I loved it.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic Distinction with a Special Flavour,"I had always heard good things about Jane Eyre, right? The same things you hear about Wuthering Heights (which is a superb read as well...more - flowery, perhaps). I got a copy from my English teacher one day thinking I'd read it that night and give it back to her the next day. Well, it took me almost a year to get around to it, but then it sucked me in. It was a long time ago since a book did that. I, myself, am quite a plain person with a passionate spirit. Jane is a person who knows WHO she is, WHO she wants to be and WHO she can't. That is this struggle. She can give in to her passion, give into her dreams, but then they will slip from her grasp because everything that makes her the most beautiful person you've ever seen on the INSIDE would be tainted; Jane's simple purity and athletic mind would be no more. So: Give in and Regret or Die and Keep Living?I love Mr. Rochester. I see him as the male version of Jane; he can see who people are without looking into their looks to find it. St. John was a handsome man, but what pleasure did Jane take in his features? Perhaps he was prudent, but he was not wise. Anyway! Rochester. He is a brave, valliant man, willing to go all measures to give Jane what he feels himself. In his own words, ""Little Jane's love would have been my best reward. Without it, my heart is broken.""Try and understand this book, and then feel that which our society lacks.One last word from a mouth that runs freely and...with INTELLIGENCE: ""It is hard work to control the workings of inclination, and turn the bent of nature: but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get - when our will strains after a path we may not follow - we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste - and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it."" (From 'Jane Eyre')This book is TRULY one of the best.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre - A True Classic,"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre is a true and timeless piece of English literature. Bront's story of the life and love of a young woman is definitely a worthwhile read. Although not without its defects, Bront's message of true love and self-discovery come across loud and clear.Jane Eyre is a story about love and its effects on a plain and simple woman. Jane, the narrator as well as the main character, tells the reader of her childhood years spent at an orphanage, her position as governess at Thornfield Hall, and her love for the master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Edward Rochester. Throughout the novel, the reader recognizes the changes love has created in Jane's character. One remarkable change is the fact that Jane forgives her heartless aunt for past cruelty and selfishness. ""`Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last, `you have my full and free forgiveness'"" (242). Love has matured Jane from a misfit orphan to a woman who has the strength to forgive. This change is just one example of Bront's insight into love and the human psyche. Through Jane, Bront explains how true love matures and strengthens people. Yet Bront does not paint an ideal picture of love, and instead shows Jane's misery and torment. ""Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love"" (324). Jane's misery is an important aspect, because it dismisses the myth that love is a fairy tale. Jane, as well as the reader, realizes that to love someone, is to experience agony, joy, and a range of high and low emotions. This roller coaster experience of being in love nurtures Jane's growth and maturity.Bront's characterization and insight into the human mind are beautifully written, but her language tends to be too verbose and detailed. Sometimes, Bront's lines seem to be pure poetry, for example when Jane is gazing on Mr. Rochester. ""I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise and the iris would fix on him [Mr. Rochester]. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious, yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless"" (176). Yet at other times, Bront repeats herself over and over again, drawing out what has already been said. For example, for more than ten pages, Bront describes Jane's refusal of an unwelcome marriage proposal. A simple ""no"" was not sufficient for Bront. The novel could have been shorter if Bront had chosen to edit certain sections of the book. Many of her sentences are run-on and complex. There are well-written pieces of poetry in the novel, but there is also a line between verbose and poetic; Charlotte Bront is hovering above that line. I think for the audience that it was written for - 19th century - the poetics and language are perfectly acceptable. Yet for today's audience that is used to instant gratification, the book might be tedious.My overall opinion of this novel is mixed. I love Bront's underlying message of true love and self-realization. Yet, the language she uses is both poetic and over-the-top. Either people will love it or hate it. Personally, I liked Jane Eyre despite its defects. It is a novel about how love makes you realize who you are and who you want to be; how loving someone is difficult and heart wrenching, but unforgettable and eye opening. Jane Eyre is one classic that I will read over and over again for its universal and timeless messages of true love and self-discovery.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,So deep and thought provoking,"Jane Eyre is just a great book... full of color and depth. It's story not for society as a whole, but for each unique individual that reads it. The coincidences that many complain about were superb to me, because in everyone's life, especially mine, strange things happen everyday that wouldn't seem &quot;normal&quot; or may appear coincidental. What I think is most prevalent about the story are the internal changes that occur in the lives of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; they're the only two characters in the book that are changed and humbled by the experiences that they went through for the sake of love. When first read, Jane and the reader are nearly &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking that this book would be another tale of &quot;true love&quot; triumping over an evil society, crossing the boundaries of wealth and caste. Such a theme is as unoriginal as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; Yet, we should already know from many other books that society will not change for the individual, and the author does a great job in showing that individuals (with the aid of God) can change for each other, something completely different than the other theme. In the end we find that society has nothing to do with internal battles that Jane and Edward faced; the development of their love had little to do with external circumstances. All in all, this book is a must read, not just because of the romance (but that part was very interesting and moving!), but for the passion and the wisdom that the author is able to bestow on the reader.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Perfect Ten. A Must-Read,"You have to read this book.Why? Because you may love it.Or, you may understand it.And it's well worth the investment to pick up this book in order to do one or the other, or, with luck, both.I read this book as a child, and it changed my life. Had I never read ""Jane Eyre,"" I suspect I would be a different person, a lesser one.When people ask me, ""How did you come to travel the world ... write ... survive ... "" there are many answers, but one of the most important is, ""I read 'Jane Eyre.'""As you quickly learn from other reviews, or from the jacket cover, ""Jane Eyre"" is about a girl who isn't much to look at, and hasn't any material wealth.If you can't identify with that kind of a person, why should you read this book? There are two reasons.You should read it because it is a classic of Western Civilization, and you should read it because it articulates, in an historically important and artistically excellent way, the insistence of one lowly born female on being a full human being.When this book was written the words ""We hold these truths to be self-evident"" had already made history -- for men.We still await the world where women are men's equals.""Jane Eyre"" has the courage to say, in relentlessly feminine language -- Jane never has to resort to a karate kick to make her point -- that women have just as much value as men. Not just women who make good eye candy. But really plain and poor and unexceptional women, as well.""Jane Eyre"" also says a heck of a lot about how women -- not all women but many -- most want to be loved. I think a man could learn much of what he needed or wanted to know about seduction just from reading this book.I've read other reviews here that speak of this book with great love, and that speak of Jane as a living being. I've read of other reviewers who read this book at an early age and felt it changed their lives.I'm part of that club.Now, stop reading this and go read ""Jane Eyre.""",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Amazing,"This book was an amazing piece of literature that's exquisitely written. The characters seem to come alive off the page, especially the heroine, Jane Eyre, who seems to have a very twenty first century frame of mind. While the plot line is fairly hard to believe, the thoughts of the heroine is what makes this piece of work a true literary masterpiece. She deals with the perils facing her with an open mind, and is willing to stand up for her beliefs and morals even in a time when this wasn't acceptable for a woman. She's a true role model for all young girls and women, and a real figure of the ages.I would recommend this book to anyone, but you have to have an appreciation for good, in depth description and old-fashioned style of writing. You also must have patience, because this is a fairly long book with many twists and turns, and there were definite times in this book that I didn't think anything good could come of it!! You must also have faith in the writer, because I was afraid for a while when I was reading that it would end horribly.I have heard many negative things about this story, but I truly don't agree with any of them. Jane Eyre, Edward Rochester, Mr. St. John, they are all fabulously written, almost as though this story was written about actual people instead of fictional.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My Opinion of Jane Eyre,"Adrienne Zillmann September 12, 2000My Opinion of JaneEyreWritten in a time when women had no rights, and were not allowed to hold any serious jobs, Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is a porthole traveling back through history. Charlotte Bronte was a sort of maverick herself, assuming a man's name in order to have her works published. Jane Eyre provides a witty, masterfully written story of a governess trying to overcome the hardships of lower-class life, and her difficult rise to nobility. It's an enjoyable story for all audiences. Bronte's plot renders many twists, provides worthy role models for all ages and genders, and presents a romantic conclusion that is heart-warming enough to make any reader smile. Though she sometimes went off track, Charlotte Bronte eventually leads young Jane along the right path of destiny by using a series of random events to guide her in the right direction. There are two ways of looking at the fluke events that befall Jane throughout the book. Some people might say that Bronte overdoes her use of uncanny coincidences when Jane happens to meet her future employer, Mr. Rochester, on the road, and his horse falls as he is passing Jane. However, the truth is, the world is a small place. Coincidences such as this happen all of the time in every day life, and much of the time, they pass unnoticed. Another such example is when Jane is looking for a job and she happens to stay with St. John and his sisters. She later finds out that they are none other than her very own cousins, and she had thought she had no relatives. This event could be thought of as unrealistic, but many people may enjoy these sly little detours from the plot and Bronte's use of destiny. This quality enhances the book tremendously by making it a far more unique, fascinating, and pleasing book to read. Another positive attribute about Jane Eyre is the happy ending. All too often, things do not turn out the way people want them to in their lives. The novel's joyful solution is a refreshing change to readers who wish their own lives worked out so perfectly. How could the story get any better? Jane, the poor, rejected orphan, finds a man so in love with her that he will forsake his own fortune and reputation to marry one of his own servants. Mr. Rochester, the eccentric, moody man he is, finds a wife so well suited to him, who returns a love so strong, that she marries a blind and crippled husband. The fact that Jane Eyre had a romantic and heart-warming ending will really secure one's opinion on the book. After all, most people do not enjoy books with unhappy or unfinished ends. They leave readers hanging and feeling unsatisfied. Jane Eyre is just the opposite. Its conclusion wraps up the story beautifully and leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It makes one happy to know that true love does conquer all. Probably the most important virtue of Bronte's whole book is the main character, Jane Eyre. If there had to be only one reason why people should read the book, this would be it. Jane has so many admirable qualities, and her own actions teach the reader many valuable lessons on life and good morals. She provides the perfect role model for readers of any age or sex when she demonstrates such qualities as self-discipline, strength, dignity, humbleness, and faith. She illustrates these traits constantly in the book, but one section that is a particularly good example of her wonderful character is when she leaves Rochester. At this point in the story, Jane has already found out that Rochester is a married man. She knows she can not stay with him because she can not love a married man. That would make her his mistress. She loves him more than words can say, and no matter how painful it is, she decides to sneak away in the middle of the night. By making the choice to abandon her own emotions and do what is morally right, Jane is demonstrating her own self-discipline and strength all at once. Then, when she leaves, taking only what she was wearing, she is retaining her dignity. She wants to show Mr. Rochester that she is strong, and she does not need anything he gave her to lean on or use as a crutch. She is an independent woman who has dignity, but she is also not too proud. She is humble when times demand so. One instance is when she is hungry, and has to go begging for food. It is an embarrassing task to take on, but Jane does it even though she realizes it will affect her own reputation. Lastly, Jane constantly has faith. She not only has religion, but a real faith in herself. When she is sick and living with St. John and his sisters, it is her faith and will to survive that keep her alive. She is definitely a praiseworthy character and an exemplary role model for any reader. As one can see by these bounteous compliments on the book, any reader will enjoy Jane Eyre, and it is earnestly recommended to someone who is looking for a good book to read. It is an enjoyable novel with a good ending, and the book Jane Eyre truly illustrates model human beings that anybody can look up to and learn from.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre--A Century Before Her Time,"Before it was fashionable or even acceptable to be an intelligent women in command of herself, Charlotte Bronte created Jane Eyre, a heroine unsurpassed in courage, dignity, wisdom and self-containment. Bronte didn't resort to stereotypes of the day by creating a beautiful but wan heroine with giddy, sensual, flirtatious or fickle allure, but rather a woman who earns the reader's respect with her naive and quiet candor, her wit and constancy. Even her plainness, mediocre physical appearance and lack of skill become endearing as Jane is created to be real.However, though I respected Jane, the tale was so sluggish in the beginning that I almost stopped reading. Most characters were dull or too unlikable, and the storyline, though of interest to me, was blandly written. It was the entrance of the tempermental and ugly Rochester that sparked my attention. The dynamics and chemistry between Jane and Rochester are the best I've experienced between two characters in a novel. Their relationship was far deeper than most romances written in the novels of Jane Austen or Georg Elliot, as Bronte explores the characters' thoughts and feelings more than she does their economic dilemmas.Having read this novel innumerous times, I count it amongst the most satisfying and engaging of the stories I've known. Not only do I collect hardcover copies of it, I also own every movie made from the book (5 to date, I believe). It isn't necessarily a flawless novel, but it is passionate, haunting and stirring in its very imperfection.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A 19th century masterpiece,"Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An unconventional heroine,"In many ways, `Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of `good' over `evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote `Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" is a beloved novel of a governess's life and love","Jane Eyre was authored by the inimitable Charlotte Bronte of the Yorkshire writing Brontes of Haworth Parsonage. The novel was written under the pen name ""Currer Bell"" in fears that it might be thought to have been by a woman. Bronte dedicated the book to one of her literary heroes William Makepeace Thackery whom she met on a London trip. Little did Charotte know that Thackery had to deal with a wife gone mad as had Rochester in her novel!Jane Eyre suffers through a miserable childhood. She is raised by a cruel aunt Mrs. Reed after the death of her parents. Jane is sent to the odious Lowood Academy where she lives for eight years from age 10 to 18.At Lowood, Janes befriends the older girl Helen Burns. Helen dies at an early age; Jane remains at Lowood. Miss Eyre eventually becomes a teacher at the school as she has learned French, sewing and social skills.Jane departs Lowood to become the governess of Adele the illegitimate daughter of Mr. Rochester. Rochester is a Byronic figure who has a madwife named Blanche living in the third story of his estate Thornfield. Jane leaves Rochester at the wedding altar when it is discovered he has a living wife. Jane flees to a home of evangelic Christians where she is courted by the future missonary Mr. St.John. He rejects the wealthy Rosamund Oliver for Jane. Jane, however, loves Rochester. In a dramatic ending the little Miss Eyre is reunited with her lover and weds Rochester. Jane comforts Rochester who has become blind and maimed due to the burning down of Thornfield. The fire had been set by his mad wife Blanche who leaped off the roof of the building. Daphne Du Maurier would use a similar ending of her novel ""Rebecca.""The name ""Jane Eyre"" can be interpreted in many ways. Jane was the middle name of Charlotte's sister Emily. Eyre may refer to her desire to fly freely in the independent air of personal freedom. Eyre also hints at the fact that Jane is an heiress. Jane also ""errs"" in some of her decisions as she makes her pilgrim's progress through northern England. The book is a Cinderella story in which a poor and plain young woman wins her lover. The dialogue is sharp, witty and the scene is populated by interesting rural servants and domestic animals such as the dog Pilot.The book contains elements of Gothic terror, romance and a defense of the rights of women. Bronte is often taught in courses on Feminism. Charlotte Bronte writing in the first person uses a rich language drawing on Biblical, Classical and Shakespearean language and metaphor. Bronte knew how to tell a good story for her life was similar to that of Jane Eyre. Bronte saw many of her sibling die young and lived in genteel poverty as a governess and teacher.Jane Eyre is an immortal classic which will continue to be read and enjoyed by future generations. It is the kind of book which will hook you on reading. Excellent and deserving of several rereadings. The Penguin edition has a large section of notes explaining Victorian customs and the literary allusions.",positive

This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre).",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Relatable Heroine (Finally!),"When Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane Eyre in 1847, she was forced by the ideals of the time to publish it under a man's name: Currer Bell. However, the novel's accurate depiction of a woman on a quest of self-discovery and love would correctly identify the author as a woman herself. In it, the title character leaves her childhood school to serve as governess at Thornfield Park, where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. However, the discovery of his insane wife makes it impossible to be with him, and Jane must leave to gain her own independence before the two can be reunited. This exquisitely written novel is truly a classic, but don't let that be a deterrent: Bronte's style remains consistently readable and lucid throughout. Add this to the effortless relatability of the title character, and we have a completely compelling novel on our hands. Throughout her master work, Bronte uses literary techniques like characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme to make Jane and her story highly relatable to nearly all girls and women.From the outset of the novel, the reader is given a very good idea of Jane and her character. In fact, the main traits mentioned by Bronte in the narrative are what make Jane so immediately relatable to the audience (which, by merit of its basic plot as a 19th century gothic romance, would logically be made of older girls and women of all ages that would find it intriguing). Jane, from the beginning, describes herself as, ""poor, obscure, plain, and little"" (272). These descriptors are reinforced throughout the novel as Jane and others describe her in terms of wealth, popularity, looks, and stature; as Jane has very little of all four of these things, she is often looked down upon by herself and others. Very rarely are fictional heroines depicted in such terms; add this to the fact that Jane has a heart of gold and Bronte has given us one of fiction's most relatable characters. Even if the reader is not poor, obscure, plain, or little, they have felt that they were each of these things at least once in their lifetime. Because Jane is so far from the ideal, the reader, as another person very far from the ideal, automatically relates to and invests in the story of Jane Eyre.Charlotte Bronte also makes Jane incredibly relatable though her usage of appeals to pathos. She makes these appeals from the outset of the novel, when Jane is sent from her relation in order to live at Lowood School, a strict institution that treats the students there terribly. Here she feels lonely and suffers lashings for offenses as quizzical as not standing when a teacher enters the room. It is when Jane starts teaching at the school that we get one of the most relatable appeals to pathos. Jane narrates, ""I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication. For change, stimulus. That petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space."" (88). There isn't a person in the world hasn't longed for some sort of freedom for a change in their life only to find it not forthcoming. Jane's desire for something new and the ability to do what she wants rather than what others want her to do is relatable on all levels of life -from a girl's elementary school years to her advanced womanhood.These appeals to pathos are also apparent in regard to Jane's love for her employer, Mr. Rochester: she believes it is unrequited for the first half of the novel and then, when he reveals that he shares her feelings, discovers that he already has a wife, insane though still very much alive. Jane's moral standards make it impossible for them to be together, and so for a large portion of the text Jane has lost her love and her dearest friend. Bronte writes, from Jane's perspective, ""It shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle: sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been, for he was not what I had thought him"" (319). Throughout this passage and many others in the text, Bronte creates a sense of loss, specifically of a loved one; this is also an emotion which can be considered relatable on all levels of the board, because every woman or girl has lost a loved one, be it romantic or platonic, and this awareness of commonality between the reader and Bronte's Jane is the obvious result of appeals to pathos made throughout the novel.Finally, the theme of the novel is perhaps what makes it most relatable: Jane Eyre is, essentially, a woman's quest to be loved on her own terms. Only when Rochester's wife has died in a house fire and Jane has achieved her own economic and emotional independence do the two marry and be together. In essence, Jane completely succeeds at her quest. ""Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and the clerk, were alone present"" (488). In their previous engagement before the discovery of Rochester's wife, he had sought to bedeck her with jewels and expensive fabrics, and he had been proud and arrogant in her love for him. It is different and far more agreeable to Jane now that he spurns the luxuries and arrogance that were once so integral to his happiness. Far more than that, the last chapter focuses on Jane's happiness with her marriage, which is in direct, though welcome opposition to previous chapters, in which her struggles, sacrifices, and hardships are chronicled. Jane, who had been a loveless orphan, now has a husband, children, and familial ties; similarly, each girl or woman who reads this fantastic story wishes for each of these things. Jane's desire to be loved on her own terms is a direct reflection of the readers; the theme Bronte creates from this--a quest to be loved--sustains Jane Eyre's relatability to modern readers.This marvelously crafted novel is truly a classic which remains highly readable in both style and plotline. Additionally, Bronte assured its immortality when she made the main character, Jane Eyre, such a relatable character. Using characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme, Bronte created one of fiction's most relatable characters. I would highly recommend this to girls and woman passed the age of ten; it truly is",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane,"I read this book when I was 13 for an English assignment in school. What can I say other than I loved it all? I when I got through half of the book I couldn't believe my luck that I still had 321 pages of adventures left. It was totally different from all the other books I've ever read -- it was shocking, it was romantic, it was haunting, it was disturbing, it was joyful... It was the story of an orphan, and her trials while she's trying to find herself. It had all different emotions and troubles, and Charlotte Bronte really wrote the book well, taking from her own life experiances. There have been sentences in the book that I have never been able to forget because of the energy and passion that the author wrote into them. ""Jane Eyre"" can be called a haunting tale about one young woman's conflict between two different worlds. This is certainly a read for everyone.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Unique Romance,"Though she writes in the Austin era, Charlotte Bront's style is unique, more mysterious (and a little darker) and less predictable than many of Jane Austen's works.I enjoyed this book because it portrays a harsh, plain, conservative, hard-working girl (like me) in a setting and a story so unlike what I live in. Because I identify with Jane on so many levels, her world becomes a sort of fantasy world to me when I read it. I am always disappointed when I reach the end.I don't think I need to explain much more about why I like it. I think it is a very well-written book. If you think you will like it, you probably will.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"I'm not usually a Bronte fan, but...","I thought that this was a beautiful and well-written novel. I was very sympathetic towards Jane Eyre from the first- I appreciated how honest and true to life a character she turned out to be, and her less-than-stunning appearance was a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) compared to some of the stereotypical heroines of that time period.What was more surprising to me was that I actually liked Mr. Rochester, because at first I admit my reaction was something like ""Oh No!, not another Heathcliff!"" He may have had some kind-of odd quirks, but I thought that he was rather endearing in a way- especially at the very end.Considering that I came into this novel expecting another Wuthering Heights (a book that I despise), I am very happy that I was proven quite wrong. Bravo, Charlotte Bronte!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Story of Jane Eyre,Every middle to high school student should read Jane Eyre because it is easy to relate to. It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges.,positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Beautifully Written,"This was my first Classic novel. While it was not fast-paced and begging to be read, it was a beautifully written novel. It was very lyrical. I thought the love between Jane and Mr. Rochester was true, withstanding the test of time. It was a truly romantic book, but not so easy to read because of the time period in which it was written. For instance, this is not a novel I would read in bed at night because I would fall asleep. Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Delightful reading,"I usually read murder mysteries but ordered the audiobook after viewing the Brontes' sisters biography on television. It's a wonderful book. I can't believe I waited this long to read a book so popular for centuries and I don't know why this wasn't required reading in school.The characters are endearing, the language, beautiful and I think knowing the history of the author makes the book much more enjoyable and realistic.I had read Emily Brontes' Wuthering Heights years ago in my teens and enjoyed it very much but didn't appreciate the history of the author then.Maybe everyone should read or watch the sisters' biography then read the books.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"This is one of the great books for love, passion and characters.","As I was in the middle of the book, I was so drawn to the characters I felt full. Later there was sadness for awhile. At the end I was full of joy. My feelings were ""wow - what a wonderful journey."" I loved the two main characters, Edward and Jane, their individual natures, their love for each other and how they pursued it. There were interesting and unexpected conversations and events. I enjoyed the way early in their relationship, Edward would pass Jane in the hallway, sometimes scowling and sometimes politely nodding, yet she was not offended because she knew his moods were unrelated to her. The St. John character was odd yet amazing. He loved a girl, but easily gave her up because he believed she wouldn't fit in with his missionary goals and service to God. Instead he asked someone else to marry him whom he did not love but she fit with his vocation. The novelist Thackeray wrote ""St John is a failure I think but a good failure."" Bronte describes St. John as being made of what heroes, conquerors and statesmen are made, but not marrying material. St. John was not a major character in the book, but I mention him as an example of the variety of interesting characters. An idea that continues to intrigue me is ""fact is stranger than fiction."" One reviewer of the book (back in the 1800s) thought one of the characters was too unbelievable and stated ""such creations as Helen Burns are very beautiful but very untrue."" Ms. Bronte responded saying that Helen Burns was a real person and that Ms. Bronte exaggerated nothing about Helen. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: 1800s England. Published 1847. Genre: historical romance.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Loved it!!,"This is a great book to read! I really love the voice of Jane throughout the whole story, making me really feel that I was reading her journal rather than Charlotte writing fiction. Definitely a must read!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Even better than I remembered,"I first read this in high school (oh, gosh...25 years ago!). I remember liking it then, though at the time I think I preferred Emily's Wuthering Heights. But as another reviewer mentioned, classic books really should be re-read from time to time. In some ways I think they're wasted on the young! Now I find Wuthering Heights a good story, though a bit melodramatic. However, reading Jane Eyre again, in my forties, I realize what an unusual book it is. On the surface, it has many of the standard plot devices of Victorian novels: a mistreated orphan, a romantic setting, a brooding romantic interest. But Charlotte Bronte's deft touch lifts this above the ordinary. She uses Jane to cry out against all the injustice she saw in the world. She addresses religious hypocrisy, women's rights, and the mistreatment of children, among other things. And it's a very good read. I find I am staying up late at night because I want to read on, rather than go to bed.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Beautiful Novel,"With this novel Ms. Bronte crafted what is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful works of the English language. One concern I always have with reading classics is to avoid their introductions as they inevitably forego on the minute details of the work (I suppose they assume everyone who's someone has already read it.) As such, I'll avoid disclosing the inner workings of the plot of Jane Eyre -- it's too beautiful to divulge and I hope you'll take up the novel for yourself.Simply put, we see Jane Eyre, the epitome of the term ""Plain Jane,"" evolve from mistreated orphan as she ascends the ladder of social status and, as with all bildungsroman novels, plummets to an even further depth than whence she came. We read as our heroine negotiates the complexities of early Victorian womanhood and confronts the haunting past of her mysterious master, all in the quest for conflicting longings for self-satisfaction, independence, and love.If interested, the reader may also enjoy Jean Rhys' 1966 classic novel Wide Sargasso Sea, which traces the story of Jane's symbolic inner woman, the ""mad"" Antoinette ""Bertha"" Mason.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A classic read that is timeless,"This is a reprint of the famous Bronte novel that even now after so many years can thrill and captivate the reader.We are introduced to the heroine Jane EYRE on the first page and we soon realise she is a most put upon child, unwanted by Aunt, cruelly treated by her spoilt cousins and mostly ignore by the servants, save for Bessie who perhaps has the best understanding of the sufferings that Jane has to ensure under her Aunt Reed's indifferent care.We follow Jane from her miserable home life in Gateshead to her time spent at a charity school, her friendship with the doomed Helen Burns and her elevation to student teacher, a role that allows her to eventually take up a post as a governess for the child Adele, the possible illegitimate daughter of the enigmatic Mr ROCHESTER who owns the eerie Thornfield Manor.From Jane's first day at the Manor we are treated to a mystery story that slowly grows and grows with each passing day, soon Jane realises that all is not well at the Manor but she is not sure what the problem is, it has something to do with the enigmatic Grace POOLE and the attic where she works, but who cries out at night and why does Mr ROCHESTER almost get burnt to death in his bed in what is obviously not an accident but which he insists is the case.Ms BRONTE'S book is suspenseful and daring, in that she talks about illegitimacy, marriages of class, and the abuse of children in charity schools to name but a few subjects she incorporates into Jane EYRE.This particular edition is excellent because it is a faithful reproduction with no abridgement and is also can be purchased for a pittance, one way of getting the classics on your shelves, I will certainly be going out and buying myself more of these editions and look forward to re-reading Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Grey and Jekyll and Hyde.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A memorable experience.,"After reading the last words of this novel, the only word that escaped my mouth was WOW! Jane's character is so real. In one way or another, every woman can relate to her passage from the insecurities of childhood to the life defining moments of adulthood.For me, Bronte's main characters Jane and Mr. Rochester mirror the traveler in Robert Frost's Poem ""The Road Not Taken,"" as they struggle between raw human desire and moral righteousness. Jane chooses the ""road less traveled,"" where as Mr. Rochester takes the well worn path. In both cases, their choice defines the fiber of their spirit.",positive

I was able to see through Jane Eyre's eyes, her world of living as an orphan in England in the 1800s, the cruel and heartless people in her life, her selfish aunt who didn't keep her promise to her dying brother to rear her as her own. Throughout the novel, Jane was resourceful, nurturous and intelligent. She became a governess for a rich employer who had his insane wife imprisoned. Jane fell in love with him, suffered tragedies of a broken heart, trials of running from her past, a new identity. She discovered loving friends and family, became rich, and marries her former employer. Every time she had a taste of happiness it was taken from her. I cried and got angry.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Template for Gothics,"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is the template for many books that followed. We find Jane Eyre the orphan child soon to be abandoned by her uncaring aunt to a stern stark girls school. Jane has a spirit that does not quake in the face of dangers. She is the model for feminists in years to come.Charlotte Bronte the author of the book was born in 1816 and like Jane had experience as a governess. Jane Eyre was first published in 1847. By reading the book one can experience the harsh times that existed in the era. Young children had little protection from society outside of their family and those without families were at risk. The school, Jane attends is a uncaring and stoic establishment. Even so Jane flourishes because of her strong spirit and desire to learn.After leaving the school Jane bravely sets out to be governess. It is here that she meets Mr. Rochester her silent and mysterious employer. Jane has the ability to see the real spirit of a person and draws for Mr. Rochester with her subtle elfin charms. Throughout the book Jane maintains an integrity of being and an independent spirit. She demands that others, who she cares for respect her as an individual as well as a woman. Jane is a person who doesn't accept the limitations which fate has set forth for her.In many ways this novel was far ahead of its time in recognizing women as individuals who were capable and independent beings. The plot is one that has been used repeatedly in novels yet to come. Any reader of romances or gothic stories should first read this to find the source of the story.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the most unique and beautiful love stories,"This is, hands down, one of my favorite books. It is not the typical romance story - the heroine is not a gorgeous, delicate, flower and the hero is not a young, virile Hercules. The characters are more realistic, allowing the reader to be more sympathetic. Jane Eyre is described as being the plainest of the plain, but her strength and independence make her a rare individual. She is a dynamic character whose love transforms her in the end.This is book really moved me.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Lovely Classic For Everyone to Indulge In!,""". . .no one ever sleeps here: one would say that if there was a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."" This a quote from Charlotte Bronte's 'Jane Eyre', a marvelous masterpiece set in the 1800s filled with suspense, action, and a pinch of romance. Orphaned when she is a small child, Jane Eyre is left in the clutches of her hateful aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her bullying cousins at Gateshead Hall. So marks the reader's advent into Jane's dreary world. Sent to Lowood School at the of ten, she eagerly expects a genial environment only to be met by a cold, hostile institution plagued by Mr. Brocklehearst, the arrogant headmaster. Despite two high points in her stay at Lowood (she is befriended by Miss Temple, a solicitous music instructor, and a saint-like pupil named Helen Burns), they are brutally taken away from her. Helen tragically dies from typhus, and Miss Temple marries a minister and moves away. Jane's only escape from Lowood is a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall eight years later (when she is eighteen) that she accepts. When she arrives at the manor, she is heartily greeted by the housekeeper, Miss Fairfax. Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner, usually travel abroad and is absent most of the time. Jane's duty is to tutor his foster-child Adele Vareans, an adorable six-year-old French girl. It finally seems as if Jane has discovered a home for herself and is at last distinguished as a bona fide person. However, her tranquility and niche are suddenly threatened when the brooding Mr. Rochester returns home. Odd events occur, such as screams in the night, crazed laughs echoing in the halls, blazing fires, and the presence of an unexpected guest. To worsen matters, Jane finds herself falling in love with her master despite the fact that she suspects he is concealing a secret past of himself from her and others. Exactly what is it and will Rochester ever be romantically interested in &quot;plain&quot; Jane? To unearthen the answers, one has to enter the allure, intrigue, and enigma of Charlotte Bronte's delightful story of the struggles, identity, and emotions of a heroine on a quest for her destiny: Jane Eyre. --P. J. Persad",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Outstanding.,"One of the greatest love stories ever told. If you haven't read this novel yet, you don't know what you are missing. The language is beautiful, and the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane will surely make anyone's heart melt. It will rekindle one's belief in true love. Once you read it, you will want to read it again right away! Don't miss actor Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the BBC adaptation! Also, Timothy's performance as Heathcliff in the 1970's Wuthering Heights adaptation is excellent as well! Highly Highly reccommended!!!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A very rich fulfilling story one of the best novels written.,"I read many many books. Jane Eyre is NOT a book for everyone not for people not willing to read a long,deep,book. Thios book has meaning suprizing twist and turn. It makes you feel sorry for Jane everything that happens to her. Charlotte wrote this book as if she were Jane. It simply amazing. It is a love story, but its certainly like nothing I've read before. It may drag a little torwards the end as the pace slows down a tad, but it picks up and holds you in suspense once again!!! This is a very ssuspensefull and emotionally enrapturing book. I suggest it to anyone looking to read a great book.God Bless ~Amy",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Freshman's View of Jane Eyre,"I recently read this book, being bored in the summer. Little did I know that this novel would capture my attention and hold it steady for three days. The character development was excelent. I felt like I was going through the trials and tribulations with Jane. I wanted to walk up to her and tell her my opinion of what to do. The story winds in ways I didn't think possible. I would be half-way through and wondering what could happen next since there was so much book still left to read. The reading was slightly complicated for me and I would have to stop and ask my parents what this (or that)old english word meant. I think that any high school girl that wants to discover more about standing up for what you believe in should most definetly read this. One of my favorite novels of any I have ever read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A timeless masterpiece,"This book's main plot, Jane's growing love for her student's caretaker, seems almost fluffy. But as the heart of the story unfolds, it plays as an example of the &quot;classes&quot; of her time, and how Mr. Rochester, her love, treated her with equality. The truly talented writer, through actions and descriptions, depicted in this book a simple and plain girl's mistreatment from her aunt and cousins in her childhood and how her past affected her future. There is no such thing as a &quot;plain Jane&quot;. I highly recommend reading this book because it will leave you thinking about it months after it is read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I Have But One Regret...,"I hate when I see a movie first, then read the book. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now, but... Anyway, this is a wonderful book. The more I read the Bronte sisters' novels, the more I like them.The eloquence in language throughout this novel doesn't dilute its greatness by hindering the reader of today by having to decipher the meaning of each sentence. The story, though incredible, is also believable because it is told through the eyes of the one who experiences it. The characters are well-rounded, the plot is juicy, and the climax is fabulous. I love how, even though it is told in past tense, it is as though Jane is reliving each moment and her moods inside the narrative correspond to whatever is happening in her life at that time. It makes her seem even more real.It is a long book, but definately worth picking up!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Amazing,"I started this book and found the beginning of it a little dull and I put it down but a friend of mine encouraged me to try again to get through and I read the whole book in less than 3 days. It was one of the best books I ever read in my entire life. Any woman, 8th grader, or over will thoroughly enjoy this romantic (tearjerking, not just a few, but many) and passionate story of a woman's hard life and wonderful romance. You will be astonished at what secret Mr. Rochester is holding in his attic.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My favorite....,"I read this book over three times. During I reading this book, I was in another world.

Charlotte Bronte given me a lot of &quot;rules&quot; for my life, because i identifire Jane Eyre with my own kindhood. I see myself in Jane Eyre, but in another timelife. Jane Eyre or Charlotte Bronte has a special place in my heart. I read also &quot;The Proffesor&quot; and &quot;&Uuml;ber die Liebe&quot;, in time I read &quot;Shirley&quot;.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Great Book!,"This book is for all ages. It was very touching. I liked how Charlotte was very descriptive.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my favorites!,"I'm a junior in highschool, and already read it at least 4 times. the majority of this book is gloomy, and one would expect a sad ending (like Wuthering Heights) yet the ending never fails to make me cry!

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The strong heroine and her one true love,"Jane Eyre is an excellent novel written with much emotion and strength. Jane is a strong heroine for the period in which it was written. She should serve as an idol for all young girls today, with her strong convictions and beliefs.

The first time I read it I was in 7th grade, and my favorite part about it was the love story. After rereading it once again a few days ago, I realize there are so many hidden meanings in the story. I recommend this book, not only because it is extremely enjoyable, but because you can learn a lot. You should read this book twice, at least, so you don't miss out on anything (it's just as good the second time).",positive

I would hope that more people would want to read this book. Many of my friends have no intrest in reading classical and long books. I actually say that if you don't think you would want to read a 500 page book then, you will still want to read this one.

There's a little mystery and plenty of heart.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic,A good book that has appealed to readers over time. The story is one that everyone should read. Enjoyed it.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A never to go out of style classic!,"This is so much more than a love story, although reading about the love story in &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; is exciting precisely because it is from a time when courtesy and appropriate behavior was so highly valued. Some may compare that kind of behavior with today's much more open and free male/fremale relations and not understand the impediments to verbal and physical demonstration of your love back in those days. However, I think that added so deliciously to the sexual tension.Mostly, I find this to be about a particular female who has an incredibly admirable personality. Independent, clever, modest yet feisty, she sets a great example for true feminism to come. We need to pay attention to the hardships she faced, and the ways in which she handled them. It sets an example for us to be better people and to face our own modern day challenges with ethics and fortitude.The characters were clearly delineated and we would have no trouble identifying them if they were to come to life. Bronte handled the English language in a most eloquent fashion, which I enjoyed very much. It is fascinating to see how a language grows and changes over time. It reflects the society it is expressing information about. What will our brand of English say about us?",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,a beautifully depicted love story...,Having always wanted to read 'Jane Eyre' and finally doing so...I finally realised what I had been missing out on all these years. You're quickly drawn into Jane's life as she takes you through numerous hardships (as her faithful reader) until the moment where she meets Rochester. It is quite an unlikely love story...but beautifully written. It has been a long time since I cried reading a book...but the tortured love story between Jane and Rochester is absolutely brilliant. Everyone should read this book at least once.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An inspiration,"I was forced to read this book my senior year in my British Lit class. I was expecting to run into yet another boring book you have to read in high school. Boy was I in for a surprise. Jane Eyre inspired me to go back to the classics and read. I'm now on my way to reading Shirley and Vilette, and I've already read Wuthering Heights.If you are not inspired and moved by this storyling, I have no idea what could move you.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Full of passion and life,"Full of passion and life, a young humble girl becomes the wife of a wealthy man? Hard to believe? It's a fairytale dream come true. Is it? An oddly written book that caught me on an emotional level",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Excellent~!,The story of Jane Eyre is so moving that I hardly put the book down once I started to read. The passion and surprises are well worth your time.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the most beautiful love stories I've ever read,"I think I like this book for the reasons that make some other people hate it. Jane and Mr. Rochester are not the typical protagonists of this kind of story: Mr. Rochester is not the usual Prince Charming, nor is Jane the usual beautiful princess. He is cold, self-centered and doesn't like children; it is difficult to see at first why she loves him. She is poor, plain and unladylike. A quiet rebel, not a fire-spewing one. She wants Mr. Rochester all right, but under her own terms. All this is narrated with unsurpassed intensity of feeling and beautiful language. The passages in which Jane uses her paintings to reveal her love for Mr. Rochester, are simply exquisite, like when she draws herself as the plain governess that she is, comparing herself with her alleged rival, a gorgeous woman of fashion, or when she draws a portrait of Mr. Rochester in order to have before her &quot;the face of a friend.&quot;A few clumsinesses of the plot can be forgiven considering the times in which the novel was written. For example, Jane receiving a big inheritance coming just from nowhere, or Mrs. Rochester being killed all too timely. At Jane's time, the only way a woman of her condition could be independent was to be independently wealthy, and the only way for her to have that kind of money was to inherit it. Also, if she went back to live with Mr. Rochester (as she clearly intends to do), while his first wife was still alive, most probably the novel would have been considered too scandalous for publication.I have read this lovely book I don't know how many times, and I always find it exhilarating and haunting. Being a fan of Jane Eyre doesn't seem to be considered intellectually glamorous these days, but then, I plead guilty to it. I never get tired of this book, and I don't think I ever will.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"More than romance, perhaps an argument for social welfare?","Jane Eyre, is my hands-down favorite novel. Breathtaking in scope, Charlotte Bronte wrote a novel that is gothically romantic (given the popular style of the day), a commentary on Victorian England social mores, and of forbidden love...breaking the barrier between class. Jane was a feminist, controlling her fate, her life, despite whatever constraints (other people, social, financial) she encountered.Anyone who believes in the dismantling of the welfare state, should read this novel (and Charles Dickens for that matter) to get a better idea of the reality of a world in which &quot;unfortunates&quot; are dependent upon the random kindness and/or charity of others.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Too many coincidences but a fun book,It's easy to understand and it starts to get fun when Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Possibly the best book I've read and ever will,"Jane had to face a tough decision, and she made the decision she thought was right, that makes me love her character even more. Everyone that loves TRUE romance should read this.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Read it on your own to enjoy this treasure,"It's sad that many people can't appreciate classics like a good movie recommended by a critic. This is the truest form of Victorian Literature, read it on your own, not because you have to.",positive

Even though she's shy, she is a loud and obsessed lover.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A truely inspiring and Creative novella,"Jane Eyre is one of the most beloved romance classics of the Victorian era, and that's no surprise at all.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Complete Woman,"James Joyce called Ulysses the only &quot;complete&quot; man in literature; if this is the case, then Jane Eyre may be the only complete woman in literature. For once, here is a woman who is intelligent, independent, vulnerable, wise, naive, cold, passionate, practical and creative all at same time. She is not someone who is easily placed in a nice, neat category and labeled, and those who call her ""depressed"" really miss the point. Although the language may not be modern the topics that Charlotte Bronte discusses are very relevant. What really surprises me is that so many people feel so threatened by such an ""old"" book. Why is the theme that you have to follow your own heart rather than the dictates of society so confrontational a subject to some people? It has nothing to do with either sex or gender, just a very human desire for freedom. Maybe some of the book's critics should wait a few years and re-read it when it isn't a required reading. It really is a wonderful book if you approach it with an open mind.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,An excellent read for all ages.,"Jane Eyre is an excellent book. It is a novel that i couldn't put down.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Old classics are understandable on E-Books,"One thing I appreciate about reading old classics on e-books such as the Kindle, is the ability to immediately look up archaic words within. Plus the fact that along with this ability, these old classics are available for free (at least for the most part).(Spoiler alert)I would say that with a few of the old english titles now under my belt, the authors of the time leave a lot to incredibility in order to advance their plots. In the case of Jane Eyre, this came up with a majorly coincidental meeting of a man and a letter in the town of Maderia (or some such spelling). Also, of a rather psychic lament being heard by the story's protagonist. Also of a chance meeting of the protagonist, on the verge of dying of starvation and privations; finding herself on the doorstep of some long lost relatives.Guess they had a lot of faith back then that God's will, will out. Otherwise it did make for a nice story. Just a bit too much of ""Deus ex machina"" for my tastes.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,"Great, but not quite as good as Wuthering Heights...","I was a little disappointed by Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. Yes, I've only just read it! Never had to at school, like so many people I know, so I had a totally open mind. I love Wuthering Heights, by sister Emily, and I was sort of expecting something of the same calibre. Maybe it is because Jane Eyre is more from the romance genre... I am not so sure. I certainly don't think that Charlotte's writing is anything near her sister's. I also find that there are two stories in Jane Eyre - the main one with Mr Rochester, and the second one with St Johns, and I found them slightly disjointed. Don't get me wrong, it is a classic, and I can see why it has so many admirers - but it is definitely not my favourite.",neutral

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Don't miss out on this classic,"Growing up I never took the opportunity to read many classics. (I didn't read much at all for that matter.) And now as an adult I have the fortune of visiting some of the great works of literature for the first time. Jane Eyre was a challenge for me initially because I believed I wouldn't identify with the character much. The more I allowed myself to become immersed in the story, the more I was impressed by Jane's courage of character, even as a young girl.Jane Eyre has an intellectual confidence, noticeable from a young age, which she draws from in order to challenge those seeking to place unnatural limits on her. Her aunt Reed emotionally abused her as a child, and still Jane had enough perspective to fight for her own justice. When she was sent away to a boarding school (with only slightly better conditions than before), Jane suffered further emotional trauma but also learned to thrive in spite of everything. Her negative experiences informed her towards a life of seeking goodness.When Jane finally crosses paths with Mr. Edward Rochester, she faces choices of both heart and mind that few women of that time would be prepared for.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A classic gothic story,"When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,really 4.5 stars,"4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading ""The Eyre Affair""(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :)",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Brilliantly conceived and beautifully executed...an intellectual and emotional tour de force,"One of the greatest novels I have ever read. I was just expecting a sort of Gothic romance, but this is so much more. There may be some spoilers in what follows, but I will try to stick to general, thematic terms rather than disclosing specific plot points.Jane Eyre is, above all, a novel about the unity, versus the duality, of mind and body, reason and emotion---or, as Bront puts it, ""judgment and feeling""---particularly as this applies to the Christian religion. Christianity is, of course, committed to dualism, but Bront, though paying lip-service to religion, rejects this, depicting its evil in many of its manifestations. Some of the devout Christian characters she paints as blatant hypocrites, but even those whom Jane respects or even admires, when it comes right down to it, she does not emulate. Jane seeks happiness in this life, here on earth, while even the ""good"" Christians are doomed to seek it only in the next, and that by sacrificing it in this one.The basic story idea brilliantly demonstrates Bront's theme: Jane is given the choice of a loveless marriage, or unmarried love. The latter situation may seem a bit contrived to the modern reader, and indeed it seems as though Bront herself feels this on some level, as the passionate appeal of Jane's lover is much more convincing than her reason for refusing him---namely, that the laws forbidding both divorce and adultery must be in place for *some* reason. (That may be generally true, but they clearly don't apply in this case, or make an exception for it.) Even when she is finally able to follow both her heart and her mind, it is only after these Christian principles have resulted in the horrible crippling of her beloved, which damns those principles all the more.In short, Jane Eyre is a book about a woman's struggle to stay true to her whole self---heart and mind---against Christianity's attacks on both fronts. I don't think it was Bront's conscious intention to write a novel condemning Christianity for sundering our hearts from our minds, but only what she viewed as corrupt interpretations of it---yet that is what she did, and it is brilliant. Both her heart and her mind were clearly much more dedicated to this life than the next, as Jane Eyre powerfully demonstrates. This is a novel way ahead of its time, in many, many ways.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre- Book Review,"The story Jane Eyre is a classic romance novel. This story was written in in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte. As you can image the story is very influenced by the social norms of that time. But in essence that is what make the story so believable. Jane Eyre is about a young girl who was orphaned and made to stay with her cruel rich aunt. In Jane's younger years she gets verbally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins. One day Jane fights back and is eventually sent to a boarding school for girls. The life style at the school is harsh and dangerous. The girls living their have very little clothing, food, shelter, and people willing to take care of them. Because of these bad circumstances illness strikes. After that occasion the climate in the school changes to one where the girls are provided for. Jane is able to get a wonderful education, and when she graduates she decides to become a governess. She puts an add out in the paper and is contacted by Mrs. Fairfax to become the governess to Adele Varnes. Jane goes to live at Thornfield Manner. She spends many happy months there. Until Mr. Rochester comes to visit. He is Jane's employer and the guardian of Adele. Mr. Rochester confuses Jane in ways that no one every has. Love sparks between the two of them. But this love is tested by secrets from Mr. Rochesters past!I found all of the characters in this story to be believable and realistic. They seemed like people you would meet on the street. Well, minus the fact that they have the mannerism of someone from the 1800s. In particular I love Jane Eyre. She is a strong woman. That any female could relate to. It surprised me when I first read the book that she was so strong, since this book was both written in the 1800s and took place there. Also, the emotions that Jane has are very realistic. While she was at the girls boarding school she lost a friend and it felt really real when it happened. I will admit to shedding a few tears when it happened. I think that the bases for a good book is if the story can touch the reader and for me this book did.I did really like the story. The plot and characters where both interesting and well thought out. At times the book was very slow and my interest was lost. It could get a little boring if you don't have a lot of patience and determination. My favorite part of the book was the ending. The ending was happy and a good solution to both Jane and Mr. Rochester's problems. It left me satisfied and I didn't have anymore questions. My least part of the book was the middle. There wasn't enough change in the story and Jane was too caught up in her own head. There needed to be more action there or even a new character. The middle just didn't do it for me.I would recommend this story to someone else. Probably an adult or a teenager. Like I said before you need a lot of patience and determination to get through the book. So, for anyone under the age of 15 it would be a very difficult read. To really enjoy this book you have to love history and a good romance. To really get this book you have to understand the motivations of people in the mid 1800s. It really wouldn't make to much sense to someone who doesn't have a grasp on history. I would give this book 4.5. The plot and characters in this story are amazing. However the plot sometimes is somewhat slow. Overall I believe that Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job writing this book.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic Novel that Transcends Time,"Jane Eyre is a classical literary work that encompasses a variety of genres from mystery to romance. The novel is told from the perspective of Jane Eyre, a young woman orphaned as a child, who struggles to find her place in the world. Traveling among many occupations, Jane finds herself as a governess and begins to develop feelings for her employer, the rude mannered Mr. Rochester. However, Jane discovers that his country estate holds frightening secrets among a mysterious past.This Gothic romance encompasses many themes that are relevant to society today which not only makes the novel relatable, but also intriguing. The reader becomes wrapped in Bronte's descriptions as the story unfolds and takes unexpected turns and twists. From the beginning, Jane struggles to find those who love and accept her as a human being. Throughout her life Jane is oppressed by others who tell her that she is not good enough and is constantly put down even when she tries to change her situation. She is told that she is too ugly, too poor, and ultimately too powerless to overcome obstacles, but she tries regardless. In every situation presented, Bront touches on relationships with people. As human beings ourselves, we are able to relate to these struggles and the ways which we attempt to survive difficult moments within life.Jane Eyre represents these themes and continues to affect readers even today. This novel presents the emotions and desires of everyday people while also including an exciting, thought provoking plot. Jane Eyre is one of those novels that will travel with you over time. Personally, rereading the book at different points in my life has allowed me to read with a different perspective which I may not have considered before.I would also recommend reading Wide Sargasso Sea if you enjoyed Jane Eyre. This other novel written by Jean Rhys tells the story of Bertha and defends some of the judgments that could be made of Bertha in Jane Eyre. The novel also questions whether Bertha's mental state was altered before even arriving at Rochester's estate. It is a very interesting companion book to read after having read Jane Eyre.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Arrogant,"Jane Eyre, a woman with courage, with passion, with determination, demonstrates a remarkable amount of pride while she lives her life. Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A quite intresting book,"This book is about Jane who is an orphan.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"The book Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is about a girl who is about ten years old, and she lives with her aunt, cousins because her parents had died when she was young.

When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him. Jane is eighteen when she went to live at the house in Thornfield.After Jane has been at the Thornfield house for so long she gets a letter saying that her aunt is dying.

Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich. The book is good and exciting until the end because of what happens to Jane in the novel.The book has a lot of mystery like when Jane had to put out a fire in Mr. Rochester's bedroom, and romance. In the book in the beginning there is discrimination against woman's rights when master John hurts Jane with his bare hands, this book does have woman's rights in the beginning and in the middle of the book. This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around. When they explain what is going on in the story with Jane the author explains the weigh she takes the problem in the novel.This book would be really good for people who like love stories and mysteries all in one.

As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a ""quick read"" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Page-Turner Gothic Romance,"The beginning is kind of boring to get through, but once you get into her adult life it was a great page turner and one of the best Gothic love stories I have ever read. In fact, someone pointed out to me that her childhood dragging on and on helps you suffer with her and gives you a lot of sympathy for the character (Thanks Miriam!). Oddly enough, when I read this a second time before I saw the movie, I found the beginning went a lot faster. So you'll have to judge for yourself if you like the pace, but either way the beginning is worth it.The movie adaption of Jane Eyre by Focus Features was very well done and I really liked it.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Checking off list criteria of secret keepers...,"Jane is not the average person, she has been through a lot and she has chosen to overlook some of other things as well. The point which haunted her was during the orphanage her aunt has consigned her to: she kept thinking those who are talented are destined for greatness, but her best friend with the fair hand was let off and killed. That was the most disappointing part of her youth and haunted her to no end and no beginning. She most willingly settled to be with a mocked up version of male counterpart of her friend from youth as repairing the damages she saw but could not escapes. Who could not but questioned her senses on why would she not accept the person who she is, but she tries to escape her own drawing ability and let the skinny girl have the crown, in the end, she makes up by letting her of all the grieves with which she felt as a child and watches another woman die in her own care. In fact, she condone murder twice to marry into her unloved imagination. I am not sure if in fact, when love being equal, she herself is any more sane and/or shameful for her desire to escape the part of her soul that does not want to see her friend as gone awry, but she could have chosen to say no, to the man who has thus found her to be a willing body for his child in custody. So the subject became the unacceptable girl and her mother became more of disowned love tale's antagonist. I don't believe the author hints at polygamy, but it wanted to be so to satiate its own desire to compete with all the other females at all cost for a chance at marriage.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Classic Gothic Novel,"My mom encouraged me to read this book when I was 13. She said that it was a great classic for girls and that I would love it. And so I did read it and love it, but now I'm amazed that I got through it. I don't have a copy of it anymore, so I read some of it on-line, and I was surprised to see that the writing is rather ponderous and even tedious. I'm amazed at the length of some of the sentences. When I was young, I didn't worry about difficult words. I certainly never looked up unfamiliar words in the dictionary because I didn't want to destroy the momentum and flow of the story. I could usually tell from the context the meaning of the word. I'd been told that it was an exciting story so I buckled down and forced myself to get into it.Before I knew it, I'd put myself in Jane's shoes, and my own life started to look really good in comparison. Terrorized by the family who raised her, abused by the administrators of the school she attended, my heart was bleeding for her and then, finally, she received some emotional sustenance from a caring, understanding teacher and a saintly, loving classmate.When she goes to work for Mr. Rochester as a governess for his ""ward,"" Adele (actually his illegitimate child), she is a love-starved, vulnerable young woman. Worldly Mr. Rochester has been around shall we say, and his heart has been hardened by various circumstances in his life. However, Jane's goodness, innocence, and intelligence win him over. They fall in love and wish to marry.But remember this is a gothic novel, and there are mysteries in the big house they inhabit. Screams can be heard coming from the attic. There's a fire one night. Strange laughter can be heard on occasion.Suffice it to say, they're not allowed to marry--as they're about to exchange vows a man storms the church and insists that he can tell why the couple should not be allowed to marry.Jane goes away, she nearly marries someone else, and then one night she believes that Rochester is calling her...Enough said, this is the sort of information my mom gave me when she was seducing me into reading this book--a Cinderella sort of heroine falls in love with an older man who lives in a big spooky house--that was enough for me. I proceeded to make my way through all those long sentences and was richly rewarded at the end. I can tell you that this isn't exactly a fairy-tale ending but it's more happy than sad. Very poignant. You'll cry, but you'll be so happy that you shared Jane's misery and witnessed her happiness.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic for the best reason!,"One of the challenges in reading a great work of literature is that it often has many imitators. The imitations may be flattering or unflattering; they may be complimentary or subversive; they may borrow just little bits or just about everything. In addition to spoiling surprises (thanks a lot, I Walked with a Zombie!) it is possible for the original source to look cliched or hackneyed after experiencing all those others. Did that torpedo this book for me?Consider some various elements in the story: The first conversation between Jane and Helen Burns at Lowood School reads like the best of Dostoyevsky. The plot meanders from location to location across England like the best of Dickens. Jane has romantic entanglements with noblemen and churchmen (it's Church of England, after all) like the best of Austen. Ghosts, crazy people, and supernatural/horrific events pop up like the best of Val Lewton.Jane Eyre does not suffer at all by comparison. The story of the orphaned girl growing up in an unloving home with an indifferent aunt and cousins, moving out to a harsh boarding school where she gets her education, and taking a job as a governess at the lonely estate of Mr. Rochester is compelling reading. Her character grows throughout the book in believable and engaging ways. There are many deep conversations about Christianity, duty, missionary work, matrimony, etc., that fit naturally into the story and arise from the people's lives. I found the book fascinating and hard to put down. This is a great work of literature undiminished by other similar works.Thanks to Julie and Scott at A Good Story is Hard to Find for getting me to read this wonderful novel.I did read the book on Kindle for Android, which means I didn't really have a book. Unfortunately there was no annotations or notes and quite a bit of dialogue is in French (with a small bit of German, too). I remember just barely enough to get through but it would have been nice to have translations available. I don't know if other e-versions have better support for language-challenged readers. It is something to consider if you haven't read Jane Eyre and don't know French. I think a reader could get by without it but it can be frustrating.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Charlotte Bronte's 'Jane Eyre' is a Masterpiece of fiction.,"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855), is a tale of mystery, passion, and perseverence. The novel follows the life of the fictional Jane Eyre, an orphan from birth, as she progresses from a student, teacher, governess, to finally, a wife. Some of the events Jane experiences are based on Bronte's own life. Bronte began writing Jane Eyre in 1846. It was an immediate and thorough success upon publication in 1847. The writing is enthralling, touching, and artful. The reader cannot help but become involved and interested in the compelling story of Jane Eyre.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,An enthralling classic,"Jane Eyre is the epitome of independence and success. Living in the nineteenth century was difficult for everyone, especially women. The conformity of their situation is shown by the author, Charlotte Bronte by the school Jane goes to. Despite the rigid life she was forced to endure, Jane started a life of her own. She faced many conflicts and difficulties in life. Fortunately, she fought and won the battle to realease the invisible bonds society placed on her. This was intriguing and well written. Though more applicable to females, both sexes will enjoy the underlying theme.",positive

But as I read on and got used to the book and fully grasped its meaning, I found that this was one of the best classics I had ever read! (And I am a BIG classics fan.)

How Jane never knew her love for Mr. Rochester was so strong until she left him. But then she came to her senses and went back to look for him. She still loved him as much as she did before, even when he was half blind, poor, and only had one hand. That's what you call true love. I love how Jane is such a courageous women to handle so many tribulations in her life. She never gave up and kept on living her life.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A classic by an extraordinary author!,Charlotte Bronte's writing is poetical and her characters are well developed.

My point of view changed as I realized that all of the families mentioned in the book are all dysfunctional, all of them had some sort of problem. I made this my thesis. In order to get the most out of this book, you must appreciate the detail of each thought that Charlotte Bronte put into text. I think this book is an excellent classic and anyone who thinks different does not appreciate classic romantics. I think Bronte did an excellent job and hope that she knows that there are people who appreciate all of her hard work. THANKS.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Still suitable for the fairer sex,"In the 156 years since its publication, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been a source of controversy - first, over its suitability for and, later, its portrayal of women. When it first emerged in three volumes from the British publishing house of Smith, Elder, and Company under the nom de plume of Currer Bell, it was popular in spite of being deemed unsuitable reading for the Christian woman. Ironically, a century and a half later, it's come under feminist criticism for its allegedly archaic and weak depiction of the Victorian woman.The story itself is familiar to many. The orphaned Jane is left in the care of her mean-spirited aunt who pampers her own selfish children. The aunt can't abide Jane's willful temperament and banishes the child to Lowood, a charity school run by the hypocritical, Bible-thumping Brocklehurst. After disease epidemics for reform, Jane becomes a teacher at Lowood and then a governess for the adopted daughter of the mysterious Mr. Rochester - a man whose many secrets threaten to destroy Jane when she falls in love with him in spite of herself.In large part, the novel is autobiographical. Bronte herself was born in Yorkshire in 1816 and sent to live with an aunt when her mother died. She and her sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge - a strict Methodist charity school where two of Bronte's sisters died (and became the inspiration for Jane's saintly schoolmate, Helen Burns). Bronte became a teacher and then a governess herself, a position she detested.Jane Eyre is a blend of romance, Gothic horror, and a literary form known as Bildungsroman - an internal and external first-person account of coming-of-age. This is the most basic sense in which Jane Eyre is radical - most coming-of-age stories were (and, for that matter, continue to be) told about boys. Jane Eyre's story is not only about a girl, but about a girl who rebels against social conventions on her own principles.Ultimately, the story is about choices and extremes Jane faces and her journey to finding a middle ground that is suitable for her and doesn't compromise her personal integrity.Spiritually, Jane is faced with Brocklehurst - the epitome of the sanctimonious Evangelical movement. She then meets Helen Burns, whose love for God is certainly sincere, but leads to passivity and self-denigration. Later, Jane finds her counsin, St. John, whose religion is neither hypocritical nor meek, but leads to ambition and self-righteousness. Jane navigates the extremes to find her own understanding of love for God, ending her tale with, ""Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus"".Jane equally struggles to find her ambiguous place in the structure of Victorian class society. She comes from a monied family to whom she doesn't truly belong, giving her the social carriage and education of the aristocracy. Yet she works in the lower class jobs of teacher and governess reserved for unmarriageable women, where her intellect and her sense of self rebel, as they did for Bronte.But Jane's deepest conflict is between her need for independence and her desire for love. Rochester offers her love at the price of dependence. St. John offers her professional fulfillment at the price of love - a conflict I found meaningful and with which I could deeply identify. The dichotomy remains 156 years laterbetween ambitious, independent women living lives devoid of love versus dutiful wives and mothers living lives devoid of self-awareness and intellectual satisfaction. Even if few women desire these extremes, they continue to be offered and expected and refusing them can be the same source of pain and confusion that Jane experiences.Her love for Rochester is tempting because he can offer her two things, even as a mistress, which she has lacked her whole life - money and a sense of family. Jane realizes that the lack makes her needy and that neediness can never be the basis for an equitable relationship.Rochester is a basically good man, though deeply flawed. He hasn't locked Bertha away which, to a Victorian reader, would have indicated his kindness given the atrocities of the Victorian asylum. He adopts Adele with little reason to believe she's his own child. But Rochester's problems are largely his own doing and Jane is clearly his intellectual and moral superior - another factor unlikely to make for the equitable relationship Jane seeks.But he does tempt her and it's no accident that at the moment of her greatest temptation, Jane sees Bertha Mason - the symbol of Victorian wifehood - locked away to the point of bestial insanity. Is it any wonder Jane flees?The final third of the book - the ""Whitcross section"" - feels forced, overlong, and dull despite its importance to the story. In it, Jane finds her family and her inheritance while Rochester gains in humility and moral strength. With these needs fulfilled, Jane and Rochester are finally able to come together as true equals.The book's epilogue, beginning, ""Reader, I married him"" has been the source of much debate. Many feel the entire last chapter in which, a decade later, Jane extols the blessings of married life, indicate that Jane has submitted at last to the mundane wifehood expected of her. However, even the first sentence belies this conclusion - Jane is the subject of the sentence, not the object of it. Like everything else in her story, marriage is something she does for herself, not something that simply happens to her. In it, she describes her marriage as ""free as solitude"", in which talking and sharing one another's thoughts are their greatest pleasures. Rather than a dismal descent into dailiness, this is Bronte's summary - that women who remain true to their own integrity and give in neither to the temptation of ambition nor that of meek dependence find what they seek - a love shared by two whole people who are able to remain fully themselves.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,My English teacher is a sadist!!!,"I have to read this book for English and I can't stand it. I struggle through about twenty pages at a time, and then drop the book in boredom. I think it is interesting that all the girls in my class have absolutely no problem with it. My judgement is not entirely fair because I despise romance novels, but unless you want a book where there is only one exciting scene, and a short one at that, avoid this book!!! If you are assigned this book, however, don't panic...there are always &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; :)",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Romantic and Exciting!,"Tis story had a little of everything, romance, mystery, horror, and more. I love this book and could not put it down. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a beautifully romantic and riveting experience.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre: Air, Fire, and Passion in Her Sentence Openers","In this timeless first-person narrative, Jane Eyre --a small, plain-faced, intelligent and honest English orphan-- recounts her childhood and latter years leading to her marriage to the mysterious Edward Rochester.What make the story fast-paced, fascinating, and ultimately admirable are not the mundane events and incidents that happen to her, but the manner in which she tells them. Within a few pages it becomes obvious that the narrator is a character who is a master of the English language. Her sentence openers are well thought out, well measured, and well balanced--a veritable fountain of wisdom.In addition, Jane owns a terrific imagination, which coupled with her lust for life, will get her to where she wants to go--but only after she experiences hurt, physical abuse, and much suffering.The novel goes through five distinct stages:1. Gateshead. This is the residence of Jane spends of her childhood, and where she experiences the cruelties volleyed at her by her aunt (Mrs. Reed) and cousins.2. Lowood School. In this school she meets the mystic Helen Burns and Maria Temple, whom Jane admires and sees as a role model. In this school she also endures the headmaster's humiliations and gratuitous abuses.3. Thornfield Manor. The manor is owned by Edward Rochester, who is her employer and with whom she falls in love.4. Moor House or Marsh's End. Owned by the Rivers family who happen to be her relatives. Here Jane received a marriage proposal from her passionless clergyman-cousin St John Rivers.5. Ferndean. A second house owned by her beloved Rochester.While we enjoy child characters such as Dickens' David Copperfield, Little Dorritt, and Pip, we admire Jane Eyre much more because she is proud and shows a fighting spirit. She fights back. ""I resisted all the way: a new thing for me,"" she tells us as Bessie takes her to be locked in the red-room, following a fight with the brat John Reed.She doesn't just let things happen to her; and the fact that very same spirit gets her in trouble, she also fights extricate herself from her predicaments. Resourceful is the word that fits Jane. I always admire the passage in the novel in which she wants change in her life and how an epiphany comes to her: Advertise! And that single action gets her not only her first employment, but also her first and only love: Mr. Rochester. But little did she know the mystery that engulfed the manor, and much less the source of the hideous laughter: ""While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ears. It was a curious laugh - distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped""The author, Charlotte Bronte, a magician of the English language will take you back to England as it was in the 1840s, making you experience the highs and lows of life in England during that period.Jane Eyre is true work of literature that will introduce readers of any age to memorable characters and a story that is inexhaustible in its wisdom. Not long ago I was moved by all the attention given to J. K. Rowling and her lovable character Harry Potter. Moved I was but not fascinated as I am every time I re-read Jane Eyre. While J. K. Rowling is an entertainer, Charlotte Bronte is a literary artist.If you like low-brow romances you won't find it here. It is a story of a woman who struggles with a world in which she doesn't quite fit. While the novel may be read as a critique of both gender and social class, it contains a strong feminist stance:Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.Or,And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude and many associates, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.The protagonist and narrator has no amazing qualities, she's a plain girl and it says so, many times in the novel, but she shows some endearing qualities --which I won't mention-- that readers inevitably discover.Ahead of her times, Charlotte Bronte, hints and unveils as much as it was permitted then, erotic tensions, boundless passions, and hateful marriage ironies. These were not qualities encouraged in Victorian women writers, and Jane Eyre was offensive to many a contemporary. That a woman should expose her inner most feelings, was unheard of:I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.Jane Eyre is a trans-formative book from which we can all learn. I always say that the depths of human emotions one doesn't find in either in psychology book or philosophical tracts--but only in fiction. ""Reader, I married him.""Read it!The writing techniques I use in this article are all explained in Mary Duffy's writing manual:Sentence Openers",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Great Read: Compelling and Entertaining,"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only ""Jane Eyre."" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic ""A Room of One's Own."" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after ""Jane Eyre"", ""Shirley,"" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic ""Madame Bovary"" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.This is simply a great read.",positive

IT WAS A ROOM THAT JANE WAS PUT INTO AS A YOUNG GIRL WHEN SHE WAS &quot;BAD&quot;. WITH EVERY DESCRIPTION IT MADE ME FEEL THE EMOTIONS JANE WAS HAVING. WHEN JANE WAS FRIGHTENED OR NERVOUS I TOO WAS NERVOUS AND FIGHTENED. WITH EVERY EMOTION FROM JANE THERE WAS ANOTHER DESCRIPTION. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DESCRIPTIVES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STORY. THE REED CHILDREN ARE A PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN EVERYTHING. JOHN, ELIZA ,AND GEORGIANA ARE DESCRIBED SO WELL THAT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION AND MAKE A FEW PREDICTIONS AS TO WHAT MAY GO ON DURING THE STORY BECAUSE OF THEIR ATTITUDES. JOHN REED WAS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A CHILD WHO WOULD TURN HIS BACK ON YOU LIKE A SNAKE IN ORDER TO GET WHAT HE WANTED AND IN THE END THIS CAME TO PASS. WHEN ELIZA REED WAS FIRST DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK AS HEADSTRONG, SELFISH, BUT RESPECTED I NEVER EXPECTED HER TO TURN OUT THE WAY SHE DID. I ALSO FOUND THAT GEORGIANA'S CHARACTER IN THE END WAS ALSO A SURPRISE. THESE THREE CHARACTERS ARE PERFECT EXAMPLES OF HOW WELL BRONTE WAS ABLE TO MAKE VISUALS WITHOUT EVER SEEING A THING.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Strength, character, and duty....","A novel that stands the test of time. Jane Eyre is an eloquently written, surprising, and captivating novel. The beauty of this tale is sometimes overlooked because of the time period from which it hails. However, one must not allow the restrains of the time period in which this novel was written restrict one from reading it. For, not only does Jane defy the roles set for her by the society of her time, but this novel, written under a pseudonym by Charlotte Bronte defies the rules of a novel for its time.The novel is revolutionary in its own singularly, and by what is captured on its pages.This is a must-read for anyone. A classic that is a necessary addition to every library.This book is above any star-rating system.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,hero in my heart,"Spiritual and supernatural themes can be traced throughout the novel-&iexcl;Jane Eyre&iexcl;, my most favorate novel which shows me how to keep my courage, independence and self-respect in life. Jane not only shows the reader her beliefs on female independence through her actions, but also through her thoughts. Jane desires to see more of the world and have more interaction with its people. While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class. Jane is disadvantaged in many ways as she has no wealth, family, social position or beauty. Jane does have intelligence though. Jane&iexcl;s courage, self-respect and independent helps her towards to her life and overcome all the difficulties, finally obtain her life and her true love.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,a classic you'll actually read and love....,"How could you not love this book? Even though it's a ""classic"" it's not intimidating like, say, Moby Dick. It has a perfect balance of everything - tragedy without melodrama, a wicked family without the modern day drug/alcohol problems, romance without mushiness, and a happy ending without sappy triteness. If you really (for some weird reason) can't get into it, rent the movie. Then read the book - you'll truly appreciate its greatness....",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Not That Bad,"Not that bad is truely an understatement. This novel is a classic, all respects to the word. I, a man, find this book to be one of my favorites.The book is strong in creativity, contains a remarkable flow from word to word, and has a grand notion of human emotion. What gives this book these qualities? READ IT!!! The three qualities revolve with each other. Creating a self powering novel that easily controls the moments of you emotion through the revealing of the plot to the audience with superb timing.Only one problem, a little too ironic at times, don't ya think.My small speal isn't even close to giving the novel any justice.&quot;It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, &quot;the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.&quot;I primarily choose this because of its connectiveness to the traits mentioned prior and because it won't ruin the book. Maybe this will be the first thing you read before reading the rest of the book. Or atleast I hope so.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A classic that stays modern,"This is written as a biography by Jane.It is an unusual format and makes the read an even better one.The author tells of the constant hardship of one young women - from childhood, on till the age of 19. Instead of collapsing and not carrying on - as was the want of young women in that era - she ALWAYS picks up and tries to find the good in a situation. Even though this was written so long ago - you can see how Jane is an equal match for modern women, who do not think that they need others to take care of them. The prose are beautifully written and even though I have seen three of the films, many times, the book is even better. The story takes you through Mr Rochester and on to her finding herself. The ending is beautifully written and there is enough of her religious beliefs in it, to make a current day religious person feal comforted. A beautiful ending that made me shed tears in the last paragraph. Don't cheat and look - All good things come to those who wait.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I was surprised by how interested I became in the story of Jane Eyre. I had to read it for my college English Lit class.,"Through out my many years of being a student there have been good and bad books that had to be read for class. Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books. I had to read Bronte's novel for my college English Lit class and at first thought it might not be that interesting seeing as it was written over 200 years ago. The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society. She becomes a sort of female detective and finally discovers where she is meant to me in the end.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""Dark and Twisty"" As My Good Friend Would Say","I really want to tell you what happens because I thought it was so good! But of course I won't because it would spoil it for you.I will say that I have been avoiding 'the classics' for a good long time (except for The Scarlet Letter which I actually enjoyed way back in High School). And I'm thinking maybe it's been a mistake. If only every book could be as wonderful as this one. I really loved it.My copy of Jane Eyre has an introduction by Joyce Carol Oats and I would caution those who don't know this story; do not read the introduction! It will spoil the story. Thankfully I didn't read it until after I finished the book and I am so glad, it tells everything that happens!Jane never forgets that she must love and respect herself first and foremost. She is clever, direct, honest and true to herself even when holding true to her principles costs her dearly.It is a gothic story, dark and heartbreaking full of love, devotion, obsession, isolation and oppression. Bronte creates a wonderful symmetry and balance within this story, I loved it, it moved me to tears.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"In one word...""WOW"" !!!","Talk about a beautifully written book ! Written in the first person, the excellent writing of the author Charlotte Bronte is both beautiful to read and gripping in its story telling power.What I found of particular interest was the moral character of Ms Eyre. There is a sense of absolute honesty about her, an honesty both to herself and in her sense towards other people that makes her truly stand out. For instance, Jane went through extreme hardships to do what she thought was morally a right thing to do, including relinquishing her lover. And then, when she has barely come out of extreme poverty, she finds out that her rich Uncle has left her a lot of money. She shows her character here by willingly sharing her inheritance with her newly discovered cousins.And the way that she loves Rochester is simply too beautiful for me to describe here in words. Read the book, and let Charlotte Bronte describe it to you in her eloquent and heart rendering prose.",positive

Of course I've thought each of those things about other books, but very rarely both about the same book. I love this book without any reservations and think it is incomparable. I can't imagine any kind of person who wouldn't enjoy Jane Eyre. Read it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,All Time Favorite,"I have reread this book countless times, starting after I first discovered it as a teen. It is a masterful piece of storytelling and the classic romance novel. I hope purists aren't offended by that classification, but Bronte's novel has all the traditional elements of a romance novel -- the meet, the attraction, the obstacles, the Black Moment, the reunion, the HEA (happily ever after) -- wrapped in beautiful writing and characterizations.Although this book has been popular through the ages, it seems to fall in the shadow of the other Jane today. That is, the author Jane Austen, whose works are told and retold in every conceivable way. I sometimes wonder if Austen gets a lot of glory today because she is perceived as a more intellectual read while EYRE is a big, fat, juicy Gothic romance. So unfair if that is true. Bronte's story is clever and intelligent, but also passionate and emotional.If anyone's interested, I've written a book inspired by JANE EYRE but set in old Hollywood. Amazon has it up for sale here -Sloane Hall. I blog a bit about it at [...]Libby SternbergLancaster, PA",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A review by a 15-year-old girl.,"Jane Eyre is a really good book. I really enjoyed reading this book. This book is about a girl who suffered a lot in her life. She was an orphan. Her parents died when she was small. Even though she suffered in her life, she overcame those difficulties. You should read this book and find out what happened to Jane in the end. I know that whoever reads this book will definitely enjoy it like I did.- Review by Johanna",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the Greats!,"A story that never grows old despite being firmly set in Victorian England. Jane is a wonderful character, an ordinary plain girl/woman with spirit and dignity. The elements of self-sacrifice and duty seem far removed from modern society but seen in the likes of Jane, her friend Helen Burns, Miss Templeton and others seems very noble. Just love it, great story.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Not necessarily feminist,"Even though feminist criticism is very important to this work, I think it is really stupid that so many people stick it into that peg and never think about it again.Jane's journey is also highly spiritual, and it makes me mad that people miss this. This book shows a wide range of human experience. I do not think that Jane has to prove anything simply because she is &#34;plain&#34;. I also don't think that Charlotte Bronte had anything to prove. She was a woman who earned her merit as a writer because she was good at it. I wish that I could write like this.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Tragic, beautiful, and romantic, a classic!","I love this book! It's one of my all-time favorites. It resonated so well with me when I first read it as a teenager. How to be true to yourself, independent, and make the best of your life no matter the circumstances. And of course, the romance between Mr. Rochester and Jane was so beautiful. I wanted someone to love me like that one day!I love how she was able to stand up for herself to Mrs. Reed her cruel aunt, the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, her self-righteous and controlling cousin St. John, and even her beloved Mr. Rochester when he would have her go against her moral fiber.It was wonderful to learn more about Charlotte and her life and how much shows up in her novel. It made this reread even better!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"A mature book, hard to understand...but for all ages...","I am twelve years old, and I read this book when I turned eleven. when I finished this book, I sort of re-read some of it, and scanned the pages over, and I said to myself, how in the world did I read this book with pure English language, written years ago, with a totally advanced vocabulary. Yet, yes, this book is at an advanced level, but so many girls between 12-15 read this book. And the funny thing is, that I don't understand the words, but when I read the book, I have a clear view of what the words mean. This is such a great book to give to your kids. I read it like, on my 11th birthday, and it is good for girls 11 and older. I would recomend this book for teens or pre-teens, and parents, don't give them Nancy Drew books. That could ruin them completely. Give them something that can make thier grades go up. They'll thank you later.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"No actually 4.9 stars, why because of the ending :(","What can I say about Jane Eyre..mm.. well it's very clear that it is amazing! 4.9 stars well I know I should have given it 5 stars but the ending was truly a bummer! I really did not like um...what happened to a certain hall at the end and a certain guy..well I don't want to give it away. But it was truly a bummer. All I can say is that if it were a fairy-tale ending I would have given it 5 stars, but hey I guess that a book is not always interesting when it ends that way right all of you JE fans. But truly a 100% bummer all of you starters..so prepare to face a 100% bummer. Hey I can't still get over the ending. But trust me it is a very 100% good book, sad, romantic most of all :), and the ending is quite shocking, and a bummer, but not alls well that ends well, but it still ended well. For the most part ;)!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""Her spirit is in pieces""","One of the reasons Jane Eyre is such an enduring piece of literary excellence is because of it's simple theme, in a book of numerous themes battling for #1, is of the ability of one human being with absolutely nothing to rise above hell and survive. Yet anyone can write about that, but only a true talent can make you give a damn about it all.Going back to those other themes, they consist of feminism, morality, personal blindness, social reform, and more. A plethora of characters that you'll despise or love or feel like kicking at one moment and hugging the next, it's a breathtaking array of humanity drenched in dysfunction, and one woman who's known nothing else and with great difficulty can still find those rungs on the ladder.Jane is appealing because of her complexities and endurance. Bronte's contemporary audiences found Jane a bit of an enigma, she's a moral strength in the toughest sense but so independent and (has been called) the first feminist in literature. Bronte gives us ample opportunity to see what the social climate was back then, and it only adds to the atmosphere of difficulty for Jane's saga as a poor governess in a male dominated world. Yet Jane is realistic because we see how she evolves from being an free spirited child to a beaten down teenager/adult who strives only to escape to follow her dreams and follow God's word, and eventually the governess who must come to terms with the man she loves and the dark secret that he carries. That's Rochester, who represents everything Jane isn't. He's immoral, crude, nasty, and is inexplicably held down by a bundle of secrets and one rather large one that keeps him a captive of his own life. They have one thing in common, they have thick shells they don't know how to get rid of.And yet Bronte weaves us a story that is full of passion and shows us the cracks in the dams that keep these characters apart, and as the numerous events and intrigues take place, we see how they grow and finally come to terms with their reality and whatever tragic consequences must occur. And at the root of it is Jane who leads us through decision and pain and her intense desire to just be a good and fully human person in a society and situation that won't allow her to.Jane Eyre is a book about us, and is an inspiring book even 160+ years later, not just because of the quality of Bronte's talent, or the brilliant plot weaving and what not, but because it's a masterpiece look at the strength of the human spirit.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Classic Forever.,"I loved this book. It's one of those books you can read over and over, and never get tired of it. It's a wonderful love story full of exciting twists. The Bronte sisters are a couple of my heros. I would encourage anyone to read this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"The movie, once again, couldn't do it justice","I had recently been channel surfing and saw that Jane Eyre was going to be on television. I was curious, being an English Lit major and never having read anything by the Bronte sisters, I figured I would watch the movie and see if the story line was anything interesting. I loved it. So, that night I ran to the store and bought the book. The book was ten times more vivid and wonderfully told than the movie (as was expected). I was delighted to revist the characters that I had briefly been introduced to through the movie. C.B. tells the tale wonderfully through the life of Jane. Her trials become your trials. Her love becomes your love. It was very intense and riveting. I can't wait to read it again in a few years!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I LOVED this book,"I loved this book because I felt the struggle Jane Eyre went through, being an abused, poor orphan forced to reside all year around at the Lowell School under a harsh headmaster. Then being forced to endure the harshness of her employer, Mr. Rochester.I pitied Mr. Rochester because he was &quot;stuck&quot; with a mad woman he locked on the top floor with Mrs. Pool. In a sense, it was sort of like a living death. As long as she remained alive, he could not remarry or have a family. I loved it when Orson Wells played this role because his large, brilliant, black eyes really showed his torment in the film. Joan Fontaine as Jane Eyre was no slouch either. Her blank stare after ten years at the Lowell school was great. I really felt their emotions in the book too, especially after Jane Eyre's friend at Lowell died of pneumonia and when her wedding ceremony was cancelled after discovering Mr. Rochester was already married.The tense part in the book and film was when Mr. Rochester's bed was set ablaze by his wife. I don't know how a man could let his mentally ill wife remain under the same roof with a child and so many lit candles to be knocked over but Mr. Rochster did it. I mean, the man must be as daft as his wife.I thought this book was a thrilling read because both of the main characters over came their problems. Yes there were consequences, but they were temporary. I highly recommend this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A long yet captivating story,"I found Jane Eyre to be a delightful read and a book that can be read again and again. It is the story of a young orphan girl who struggles to find her place in society. The story begins with Jane as child living with her aunt and cousins. Jane is a spirited girl and is disliked by all, especially her aunt, who constantly belittles her, despite the fact that Jane's cousins are horrific. Jane's only friend is the maid, who gives her comfort from time to time.Finally it gets to the point where Jane fights back and her aunt chooses to send her to boarding school. Lowood is a place of discipline and seriousness. The girls are educated in harsh conditions. It is here that Jane makes her first friend and learns much from her. After many years at school, Jane decides she wants to work and make money. There are not many options for a woman of her time who desires a career, but she lands a job as a governess for a young, French girl. Jane enjoys teaching and looking after her, but she also longs for something more in life.After being there for some time, Jane finally meets Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who spends little time there. He is a short, rather ugly man and Jane piques his interest as a girl with intelligence. After numerous encounters, they profess their mutual affection and plan on getting married. Although Jane loves him, she cannot ignore their obvious class difference.On the day of their wedding it is revealed that Rochester is already married to Bertha; a crazy Jamaican woman living on the top floor of the house. Jane is shocked and decides she cannot marry Rochester despite his pleas. She packs up her things and runs away.Jane spends time homeless and starving until strangers take her in. St. John is a missionary who is later revealed as Jane's cousin. The death of Jane's uncle leaves her with a fortune, turning her into a financially independent woman. Despite the fact that he's her cousin, St. John asks Jane to marry him and accompany him to India to do missionary work. What does Jane decide? Read the book and find out!Jane Eyre is novel filled with passion and symbolism. Fire appears time and time again, symbolizing the heat that exists in Jane's life. I found Jane to be a strong and admirable woman, though there are times when her sensibility gets a bit annoying. Rochester is a little odd as well, but together I find them charming. This story is unique because the heroine is a plain, poor girl who triumphs over class barriers, which is why she is so likable. She is not a beauty queen who is swept off into the horizon by prince charming. Altogether, a passionate story of courage and triumph.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The orignal romance novel,"Jane Eyre has been hailed by many to be the original romance novel and after reading it, I am inclined to agree.Jane is an abused, forgotten child who is sent away to a boarding school after standing up for herself against her cruel cousins and unjust aunt. While at school, Jane learns disicpline and becomes a very religious person.When Jane finally leaves the boarding school, it is for a governess position at the home of Rochester. She teaches the child in his care, Adele.Through the story, she and Rochester face many dilemmas in their search for true love. A true love that is right in front of their noses.If you like romance novels or if you just want to rediscover your hope for love, I recommend this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Glorious, passionate and timeless","This book is one of my favourite books ever! I must have read it about a thousand times and I'm still not fed up of it. For those of you who are under the impression that this is a boring, dried up dull book, you could not be more wrong. I have never read a book so rich, so passionate and so moving. The love of Jane and Mr.Rochester is wonderfully depicted by Charlotte Bronte into true love's deepest and richest form. Her language is vivid, descriptive and romantic, and the dialogue (especially between the two protagonists)is poetic and eloquent. This is a book for all tastes, and the characters are so well portayed that they come alive in the imagination and stay there. I actually found myself crying towards the end. And Jane, though she appears meek and mild, is actually resolute and fiery and follows her religious principles dutifully to the extent of losing her only happiness. She is, in short, possessed of a strength and fortitude both reamrkable and admirable. As for Mr.Rochester,he is an archetypal Byronic hero: dark,enigmatic,cynical,sardonic and sternly attractive, suffering from some mysterious sorrow which renders him aloof and forbidding and forms the basis for the 'secret of the attic. This book has everything: romance, tragedy, intrigue and humour and is a classic in the true sense of the word.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Independent woman or delicate bird,"In the novel Jane Eyre, Bronte wants the reader to perceive the main character, Jane Eyre, as an independent young woman trying to make her way through life by herself. Jane is even given a line &quot;I do not think, sir you have the right to command me, merely because you are older than I...&quot;(139) to help understand her independent way of thinking. Bronte tries to give and describe Jane through feminist characteristics. Throughout the novel, however, Bronte uses a literary motif of birds. In this motif everytime Jane is compared to a bird it is a bird such as a turtle dove which can be compared as weak and delicate to that of a raven which is how the main male character is described. This novel is an enjoyable one and I would recommend it to anyone who reads only for pleasure purposes. If you try to find a deeper meaning in this novel you may get confused on how the author really wants the reader to portray the main characters.",positive

This is too much to comprehed.Is Charlotte Bronte trying to highlight the plight of women, or is she exposing how passive they are?All in all, it is a &quot;nice&quot; novel, with the &quot;goodies&quot; and the &quot;badies&quot;.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Quickly became one of my favorites.,"There is something to be said for classics and this is definately a deserved one. The character of Jane Eyre is one that is so intriguing that we envy her life in a way yet we are gald that we do not live it. The book itself is one that cannot be put down in pure fear that while you are not reading a tradegy will befall our Jane. The majestry of the characters that Charlotte Bronte offers us is near perfection. With this it is also good to see a refreshing and different perspective of the upper class and its ways during this time period. I would speak of the unforgettable love story that by some luck befalls on our main character, but the majic and wonder of a love such as that is one that can only be read and imagined- not described by the ordinary writer such as myself",positive

I kept turning pages, wanting constantly to know what happened next. This book seemed to breath a life of it's own, which captured my heart.

I was happily surprised to find that the book was truly a classic, in a sense larger than that of the &quot;classics&quot; spoken of in the literary world. I found the novel to be fascinating, as well as endearing. Just like Conrad's opinion on forgetting novels, I truly don't fear that I will forget the factual details of Jane Eyre, because it has become a part of me, and it will stay with me forever",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Simply not my style,"Prior to tackling this work, I had only read one romance novel that I have every liked - Gone with the Wind. Reading Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; did not change that statistic. While I can acknowledge the worth and eloquence of this novel, I cannot say that I enjoyed it in the least. It took a determined effort for me to read it through, and I was quite relieved to reach the end.From my experience, I have yet to meet any male who has enjoyed this book, and have yet to meet a female that didn't adore it. I don't know what it is about the books by the Bronte sisters and Austen, but for some reason, the gender gap seems a mile wide.For what it is, I am sure it is a great book worthy of the praise it has received.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Not for me but...,"It was still well written and CB is good at keeping her readers interested in the characters and the plotting of the story. The ending was rather a bit too predictable for me and after investing two sleepless nights into this book, I was extreamly disappointed in the ending of this story. It is also a romance novel. I am not a great fan of romance novles without a complicated and intensely created plot so this element of the book did not appeal to me at all. I should've read this book as a young adult, as this is the audience the book is geared to. I would've enjoyed it more then. But if you are a fan of romance novels with many trials and tribulations of course thrown in, this is an elegant tale for you.Now in assessing the art of this book. When I first looked through this book and read it I was not happy, though not disappointed in the artwork. After reading this book and looking at the artwork of other versions of this story, I was a little miffed. The artwork is mostly of Jane Eyre, and none of the artwork really captured her features and personality at all. This cast a darkned element over the book and almost ""forced"" a victorian viewpoint of this story. I think the artwork of other versions are much better by comparrison.",neutral

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Rereading the classics,"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Jane Eyre is one of those books. It wasn't a quick read, and it did drag on at times. Honestlyh, I thought to myself quite often, ""What amd I doing reading a gothic romance"", but I carried on. I had also seen the 2011 movie adaptation (which I also recommend) and wanted to fill in the missing pieces. I also wondered what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a young person (teenager)? I probably would have hated it! I'm glad I read it this summer as upon reflection I did enjoy this Bronte novel. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Love it, but the writing is a bit dull at times","Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even ""passionate"", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top ""coincidences"" which might have been classed as ""providence"" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient ""coincidences"", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""I need not sell my soul to buy bliss""","""I need not sell my soul to buy bliss""Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, ""Gone with the Wind""! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator (Josephine Bailey) was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, ""Wuthering Heights"", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",positive

All I say is that there was an Anti-Semitic comment by Jane Eyre in the middle of the book that turned me down. I started to doubt Jane's moral and could not recover from that ignorant statement. I finished the book just to know how that story would end. I don't have any admiration for the character.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Flawed,"It seems that the basic purpose of the character Jane Eyre is to suffer nobly and then eventually succeed. Both elements are highly problematic as presented. Her noble suffering acts to undermine her actual character, making someone that reacts the same to most of the challenges--stoic, determined, largely silent, resigned. This required attitude makes her too much of a blank slate, too reactive, with insufficient personal details to be memorable or seem like a complex psychological portrait. One gathers that Bronte was trying to subvert common norms in representation of woman, by making Jane a lot plainer and less accomplished than was the usual style. She may have made a major improvement in this, and as discussed below there are some interesting elements to all this, but the basic result undercuts the character's agency too much. Jane can work as a symbol, she does not work as a person, and the novel is too deeply linked to her consciousness for that to be a passable loss.As well there are major pacing issues and apparent questions on the larger arc, with much of the first hundred pages and the last hundred and fifty being off-tangent to the necessary interactions for the particular story. Still, it was hardly the worst or most difficult work to get through. For much of the first two hundred pages I found it moderately enjoyable, without thinking it was very good. I was reading it as a dark comedy, framed by a blank protagonist in a fundamentally ridiculous situation. The humor--genuine though presumably unintended--came from the contrast of the stylized language forms and general etiquette focus and how cruelly people acts. See in particular the treatment of Jane in the devil child scene, in the way that's she stiffly defends herself as opposed to how the school argues she's a literal follower of the devil, and how that's a bad thing. Amusing, in a twisted sense, at least as I took it.Where I stopped being able to do this was precisely the point that the horrid and creepy Mr. Rochester became crucial to the story. He was a fundamentally twisted, harsh and disturbing person in his own right, and the eventual arc of the book where Jane does marry him and this is apparently a good thing fatally undermines the book. The way Jane plods on is problematic in itself, but it's what he ultimately plods to that is truly wrong. Rochester's focus on pride and control, his lies, his age, his borderline-deranged manner of fixating on women, the fact we have only his own word on the true story with his first wife, all these make Jane's eventual marriage with him very far from a happy thing. Yet the book seems insistent to regard it in this light, as if Rochester's injury has in itself transformed his character enough that Jane waiting on him for the rest of his life a satisfying resolution. It's the ending scenario that makes the conclusion of the author and the whole structure of the narrative less than even good.Nevertheless, the novel is an accomplishment in a number of ways. That it exists at all, that early in the nineteenth century a woman could be published. Furthermore, it's extraordinary that she was able to include so centrally in her work a protest and anger against the systemic condition of women of her time, and that both elements have been perpetuated down into the present. Creepy as some of the above subtext is, that's a worthwhile development amidst what was a pretty terrifyingly close-minded century.There's also some interesting stuff at work with religion, class and attitudes in the nineteenth century context, Jane occupying a bit of a hybrid position in all of these, not affluent nor truly destitute, not tightly religious or a firm skeptic. The hybridity of her position is very revealing to a lot of norms that we might not see in novels of the period, as her very existence in the text portrays social structures even while it undermines them. Jane Eyre the character and book are transgressive in certain ways, then, and the way this plays out is interesting. Yet, I find this appealing and informative more in my hat as historian than as a reader. The book is quite revealing of the cultural context of the author, but that's going to be the case for almost every book ever published, and it's notably less effective in framing the context for its invented narrative, cast of characters, and atmosphere. I could forgive a lot more in this book, and even come to value much of it, if it weren't for that ending that pushes the whole thing into a disturbed romance. However the book does, and so let it rest.Jane Eyre reminds me of and is better than: Bronte's Wuthering HeightsJane Eyre reminds me of and is worse than: Shelly's Frankenstein",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,The most overrated book of all time,"I've never understood why everyone lavishes so much praise on this book. It is the most overrated book ever.One of the most fundamental things a book has to do is hold the reader's interest, and in this aspect, Jane Eyre fails. To be fair, it is utterly gripping throughout the first ten chapters. After that, the quality of the book falls off sharply. The rapid pace becomes boring repition of having to go through thirty pages of nothing to get to a page or two where something actually happens, then another 30 pages of nothing.It's kind of a shame really, for a book that started out as well as this one to crash and burn the way it does.

Both of her parents died when she was little, so she was raised by her wealthy Aunt Mrs. Reed. Like Cinderella, Mrs. Reed favors her own children rather than Jane. This book shows how the need for Love can cause so many complications in Jane's life.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane off to a school named Lowood. This gave Jane a chance to be independent and live her own life. She soon made a good friend named Helen, who always encouraged her when she feels down. When Jane found out that Helen is sick from a disease called consumption, she rushes to see her. Helen soon died in Jane's arms, which made her feel sad because she had just lost a good friend. There was no one there to make Jane feel better anymore. This was the first complication in her life.After a couple years at Lowood, she became one of their teachers. After two years of being a teacher at Lowood, she wanted to experience something new, so she arrives at Thornfield to teach an eight-year-old French girl Adele. Mr. Rochester was the owner of Thornfield. Jane saves Mr. Rochester from a fire caused by a servant and secretly falls in love with Mr. Rochester. When Mr. Rochester brought back a beautiful young woman Blanche to his house, Jane developed a huge tub of jealousy towards her. Jane couldn't stop thinking what would happen with Mr. Rochester and Blanche. Jane was forced to attend a party where Blanche and her mom were there also. They didn't treat her very nicely causing her to leave the party. While watching Mr. Rochester and Blanche together, she thinks they would get married soon. This made Jane think that she should maybe let go of the feelings she had for Mr. Rochester. Her love for Mr. Rochester was the second complication in her life.Jane founds out later on that her Aunt Mrs. Reed suffered a stroke. Jane tries to relieve the hatred her aunt has for her, but she didn't want to and soon died. This made Jane sad because she barely had a chance to talk with her aunt and say good-bye. Jane didn't want things to end how it did with her aunt because it's not a good feeling knowing someone still hates you after they die. This is another complication to her life.Mr. Rochester bumps into Jane in the garden, and they started walking together. Mr. Rochester tells Jane that he is thinking about asking Blanche to marry him. This caused Jane to turn into a jealous woman. She quickly tells him how much she loves him and stunned to find out that Mr. Rochester actually wanted to marry her and not Blanche. She didn't believe his words. Mr. Rochester explained that he only said he wanted to marry Blanche to see what her reaction would be. Jane happily accepts and agrees to marry Mr. Rochester. Mrs. Fairfax doesn't agree with the marriage because she views Mr. Rochester as a proud man and too old for her. Jane was very uncomfortable hearing those words from Mrs. Fairfax. Jane began to have weird dreams of her children dying or crying for help which causes her to be more uncomfortable for she doesn't know what is happening and why she is having such dreams. Despite what Mrs. Fairfax said or the dreams she's been having, she still wanted to marry Mr. Rochester because she loved him very much. They were walking down the aisle ready to be announced husband and wife when someone announced a secret that ruined the whole evening.Will Jane ever find happiness and love or will she be lonely with no one to care for her? Read to find out if this will be the end of Jane and Rochester's love for each other.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Amy's Review on Jane Eyre,"Jane EyreI liked the book. i thought it was neat how the author wrote it as an autobiography. it was pretty interessting.like how the girls were treated in lowood school ws upsetting, and how she meets Mr. Rochester... I KNEW IT WS HIM!!! and when she finds out he ******** ( dont wanna ruin anything!)and i was like... woa...wow...no way... and then they all ******* ( oh, there i go again, i'm horrible!)i thought it was allvery interesting.i recomend this book to someone who likes to read. and someone whos interesed in england in the 1800's, or even someone who likes love stories.i think anyone would like i really.BYE! its past my bed time.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Monotonous at times,"I first tried to read this book in 3rd grade. I got through 200 pages but couldn't take any more.Now I'm going into 7th grade, and I've actually read it. This book really isn't that reader-friendly, and you have to (really)force yourself through some parts. But the rewards are great. Right after those long, monotonous sequences are over, you'll run into a really unexpected twist in the storyline that will shock you.I can understand why people give this book bad ratings, but in my opinion, the highs are worth the lows.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Maybe I'm just too opiniated,"While Jane Eyre is supposed to be one of the greatest novels of all time I can't say that I liked it nor disliked it. I don't think that I liked the character of Jane very much. I understand that she was mistreated and that she also lived in the 1700's but I still think that she was rude. She had no confidence and no pride. She would not let people love her and treat her nicely. When Mr. Rochester asks her to marry him and then wanted to take her out and buy her a nice dress and jewlery, she acts so coldly towards him that it makes me sick. Maybe I didn't like her character because I have self confidence and am very opiniated. Neverthless, I still believe that Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, I don't love or hate many characters, but I hated Jane Eyre.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Tooo Predictable Boring Classics,"I read this book for an english project and I got a 60% on it cuz I trashed the book. All i said was that the classics are not going to be so appealing to modern &quot;young&quot; readers like myself today because the &quot;novel&quot;(not jane eyre, read this literaly) has suddenly risen so much in content, state and depth. I dunno, perhaps if i was living during that era i would have appreciated the book more, but living in the 90's where you have authors such as atwood there's no competition and you really can't compare novels written before the 20th century to novels written in the 20th century anyway. Like a majority of the classics, the plot is almost always predictable and characters are indeed relatable but hell, boring! charles dickens is probably the most boring writer i've ever come across (no offence to all u dickens fans out there) and jane austen comes pretty close to him,though her books have a longer attention span. And the brontes, they're on the same level. I am not saying that the classics are bad cuz i know that if it weren't for these authors, we'd be nowhere in literature as we are now. However, my argument in my project was that books have suddenly become more interesting thru the years. Welp, aside from this (i'm still mad over my mark btw)...Jane Eyre is a book you'll either like or hate, or sleep over!",negative

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,Dry dissertation of romantic drivel,"Although I hate to douse such a highly acclaimed story with a lowly single star rating, I can say with certainty that &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; was by far the worst novel I have ever read.I can see how followers of Romantic love stories would find this legnthy tome a lovely and engaging read. However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Not my favorite book ever.,"I also had to read this book for school, during summer. I can respect the fact that it was a classic but it just was not a book that I enjoyed. It had many unneeded parts and tended to repeat itself. It was especially boring when Jane landed at Moor House. If you are a hopeless romantic then go for it, but I prefer exciting books. The other book I had to read was Lord of the Flies and I liked it much better. So....there^^;",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,Book isn't a good choice for young readers.,"Jane Eyre may be enjoyed by older adults (with a bigger vocabulary, I should add), but I had to read this sophomore year and absolutely hated it.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Jane Eyre... The ugly duckling :(,"There isn't much to say about this book. Other that I had a group assignment a few months ago to read this, and then present it to our fellow peers. Lets see, how can I put this into words? Well, it was pretty self torturing. Page after page was about fifty billion paragraphs of Charlotte Bronte describing a landscape or the ""confusing"" emotions that Miss. Eyre was having towards her boss. Although, it must have been tough writing a book which displays a woman of independence and such, Ms. Bronte is a decent writer... the book would have just been more enjoyable if there was splashes of complete randomness.As for myself, I really do not plan on reading this book, ever again. Unless some Iraqi solider is torturing me with an ablazed iron rod and screaming at me to tell him about the great collections of Charlotte Bronte and her infamous book, ""Jane Eyre"".",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Pride and Prejudice: A Classic,"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,I only wish there was a rating of zero stars...,"because this book deserves it. I first read it in the 9th grade, and it was literally a struggle to the very end. Summoning all my effort, I laboriously read this book with a lack of interest unsurpassed to this very day. It was useful only when I had trouble falling asleep.Each page of this dull, overly dramatic book felt like an eternity. There are pages upon pages of meaningless and increasingly uninteresting rambling. Plain Jane gains no sympathy from me. Apparently, she enjoys suffering, as evidenced by her constantly changing opinions and the way she strives to make her life more difficult when handed easier options. (Ex: When the guy finally admits his love for her, she goes off into the rain, poor and near-death, upon the advising of some voices she hears.)The plot is long and unbelievable. For example, how can you hide a woman in your house for years, a woman who, by the way, screams, throws fits, and sets things on fire? And nobody notices this? The ending is no better -- sappy and contrived, it left me ill.Absolutely hideous, I would not even recommend this to the worst of my enemies. This book fails to become even briefly captivating. It starts off horribly and, impossible as it may seem, only gets worse throughout.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,"I LOVE classic romance, but not this!","I enjoy classic Victorian era romance , and this by far is the worst book I have ever read. I know that Jane's character was suppose to be ""Plain Jane"", but I in no way found her endearing. Instead of feeling sorry for all her misfortunes and lack of love, I found myself detesting her character. The plot drags on forever, when really it could be told better in five minutes. It could be romantic, except that the plot is so boring and outlandish, that it overshadows that element. And the supernatural elements of the novel literally made me laugh out loud. I could go on about why I hate this novel, but I don't want to ruin the story for others.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Jane Eyre,"After reading Jane Eyre, I was glad to be done with this book. Most women enjoy and appreciate Jane Eyre, but since I am 15 I have a different opinion.Jane Eyre is 641 pages of a woman trying to find herself. Jane, the main character, goes to a charitable school for 1/4 of the book. During school, nothing really happens. Yes, Jane and her classmates are treated poorly, but it didn't hold my attention. The book does pick up until after Jane leaves school.From there Jane meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. The only thing about their relationship is Jane is 19 or 20 and Mr. Rochester is almost 40. I felt that I could not relate to these characters because today such an age difference is looked down upon by people. Of course Jane and Mr. Rochester plan to get married, but Jane finds out about Mr. Rochester's deepest darkest secret. THEN SHE RUNS AWAY! What a stupid girl. Jane may have been an independent woman, but big deal; so many women today are independent. Is that why so many people love this book? When Jane runs away, this part of Jane Eyre is so unbelievably boring. Jane meets her cousins, but realizes that she still loves Mr. Rochester. Not much happens except Mr. Rochester is blind. Jane and Mr. Rochester get married and live happily ever after.You might love this book, but as I said before I am only 15 and can not appreciate Jane Eyre, the character and the book. If you are a teenager like me do not read Jane Eyre or even waste your time. Maybe if you are older and found your true love, you might love every minute of this book. I recommend if you are young, read a book that takes place during the present, not the past.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,Watching tomatoes rot is more interesting than Jane Eyre.,"While sloshing through the almost unreadable text of the verbose Charlotte Bronte, one can imagine why she was never married. Don't get us wrong, it's not that we don't understand the underlying themes and the higher level concepts; they just contain absolutely no relevance whatsoever. The plot, dare we call it that, winds slowly through the 400+ pages of this so-called classic. If you must read it for school-don't.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Classic for a reason,"Very old fashioned and, for some, I suppose difficult to read due to the antiquated dialog - but a gem worth sticking with! Like Jane Austin, Charles Dickens and all their contemporaries, there is a very good reason that these classics are still widely read even by those of us not in need of a good grade in English Lit. It's because they are wonderfully intricate and well told tales, fabulous stories for those of us hungry for the next line, the next challenge and the next twist of fate. The Book is ALWAYS better than any film, so read this instead of downloading the old Orson Welles film to get all the nuances the writer intended... then definitely watch the film too!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Do not miss out on this book...,"You know all those 'classic' novels you read in high school? How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Masterpiece For The Ages - Superb!!,"I first read ""Jane Eyre"" in eighth grade and have read it every few years since. It is one of my favorite novels, and so much more than a gothic romance to me, although that's how I probably would have defined it at age 13. I have always been struck, haunted in a way, by the characters - Jane and Mr. Rochester. They take on new depth every time I meet them...and their's is a love story for the ages.Charlotte Bronte's first published novel, and her most noted work, is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story. Jane is plain, poor, alone and unprotected, but due to her fierce independence and strong will she grows and is able to defy society's expectations of her. This is definitely feminist literature, published in 1847, way before the beginning of any feminist movement. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the novel has had such a wide following since it first came on the market. It is also one of the first gothic romances published and defines the genre.Jane Eyre, who is our narrator, was born into a poor family. Her parents died when she was a small child and the little girl was sent to live with her Uncle and Aunt Reed at Gateshead. Jane's Uncle truly cared for her and showed his affection openly, but Mrs. Reed seemed to hate the orphan, and neglected her while she pampered and spoiled her own children. This unfair treatment emphasized Jane's status as an unwanted outsider. She was often punished harshly. On one occasion her nasty cousin Jack picked a fight with her. Jane tried to defend herself and was locked in the terrifying ""Red Room"" as a result. Jane's Uncle Reed had died in this room a little while before, and Mrs. Reed knew how frightened she was of the chamber. Since Jane is the narrator, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the child's feelings, her heightened emotional state at being imprisoned. Indeed, she seems almost like an hysterical child, filled with terror and rage. She repeatedly calls her condition in life ""unjust"" and is filled with bitterness. Looking into the mirror Jane sees a distorted image of herself. She views her reflection and sees a ""strange little figure,"" or ""tiny phantom."" Jane has not learned yet to subordinate her passions to her reason. Her passions still erupt unchecked. Her isolation in the Red Room is a presentiment of her later isolation from almost every society and community. This powerful, beautifully written scene never fails to move me.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane away to the Lowood School, a poor institution run by Mr. Brocklehurst, who believed that suffering made grand people. All the children there were neglected, except to receive harsh punishment when any mistake was made. At Lowood, Jane met Helen Burns, a young woman a little older than Jane, who guided her with vision, light and love for the rest of her life. Jane's need for love was so great. It really becomes obvious in this first friendship. Helen later died from fever, in Jane's arms. Her illness and death could have been avoided if more attention had been paid to the youths. Jane stayed at Lowood for ten years, eight as a student and two as a teacher. Tired and depressed by her surroundings, Jane applied for the position of governess and found employment at Thornfield. The mansion is owned by a gentleman named Edward Fairfax Rochester. Her job there was to teach his ward, an adorable little French girl, Adele. Over a long period the moody, inscrutable Rochester confides in Jane and she in him. The two form an unlikely friendship and eventually fall in love. Again, Jane's need for love comes to the fore, as does her passionate nature. She blooms. A dark, gothic figure, Rochester also has a heart filled with the hope of true love and future happiness with Jane. Ironically, he has brought all his misery, past and future, on himself.All is not as it seems at Thornfield. There is a strange, ominous woman servant, Grace Poole, who lives and works in an attic room. She keeps to herself and is rarely seen. From the first, however, Jane has sensed bizarre happenings at night, when everyone is asleep .There are wild cries along with violent attempts on Rochester's life by a seemingly unknown person. Jane wonders why no one investigates Mrs. Poole. Then a strange man visits Thornfield and mysteriously disappears with Mr. Rochester. Late that night Jane is asked to sit with the man while the lord of the house seeks a doctor's help. The man has been seriously wounded and is weak from loss of blood. He leaves by coach, in a sorry state, first thing in the morning. Jane's questions are not answered directly. This visit will have dire consequences on all involved. An explosive secret revealed will destroy all the joyful plans that Jane and Rochester have made. Jane, once more will face poverty and isolation.Charlotte Bronte's heroine Jane Eyre, may not have been graced with beauty or money, but she had a spirit of fire and was filled with integrity and a sense of independence - character traits that never waned in spite of all the oppression she encountered in life. Ms. Bronte brings to the fore in ""Jane Eyre"" such issues as: the relations between men and women in the mid-19 century, women's equality, the treatment of children and of women, religious faith and hypocrisy (and the difference between the two), the realization of selfhood, and the nature of love and passion. This is a powerhouse of a novel filled with romance, mystery and passions. It is at once startlingly fresh and a portrait of the times. Ms. Bronte will make your heart beat faster, your pulse race and your eyes fill with tears. The Best!!JANA",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the Great Romances,"Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find.

After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,I love Jane Eyre but the Footnotes Ruined It,"Don't get me wrong, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. However, this version of Jane Eyre has millions of footnotes so you are forced to constantly flip back and forth to see if the footnotes are saying anything useful.When the character Adele is speaking paragraphs of French, they don't bother translating it for you but they will gleefully tell you what's going to happen one-hundred pages later in the book.Reading this version of Jane Eyre is like watching a movie with an over-enthusiatic friend who keeps talking through the whole movie and telling you what's going to happen. If you're going to read Jane Eyre, I would reccomend different version",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Love Story Sublime,"There is so much to be said for this novel that it's difficult to know where to begin. It is a superb evocation of a time and place; it is a complex, detailed character study; it has a believable and compelling plot; and, more than anything else, it is a magnificent love story.Of course, love stories are the common denominator of human existence and have been the subject of literature since mankind first put charcoal to rock, so the fact that Jane Eyre is a love story is nothing terribly significant. No, what makes this novel so special is the thoughtfulness with which its narrator, Jane Eyre herself, documents her love affair. She is extremely intelligent, she carefully analyzes her feelings and actions, and she is scrupulously honest with both herself and her reader. This is what sets it apart: it is the depth of these thoughts and feelings that make the novel interesting. Beyond that, though, it is the character of Jane, slowly revealed, that makes the novel a delight.The plot is Jane's story. Orphaned, she is sent to live with her cruel aunt and cousins. At the age of ten she is sent away for good to a charity school, at which she gets her education, but which is run in such a miserly fashion that many of the students there actually die of disease and starvation. Jane survives, and at the age of eighteen, is able to secure a position as a governess to a child in a great house of England: Thornfield Hall. It is owned by Edward Rochester, the man who will become the centerpiece of her life.How the two begin to slowly realize their affection for one another, how they then cautiously begin to act on their feelings, and how they must then surmount the obstacles in their path--both societal and self-inflicted--are what make up the bulk of the novel. There are at least a few surprises along the way. The strong-willed Jane's moral code requires that she respond to these difficulties in certain ways. It is to the novel's and the author's great credit that these decisions are never simply made; Jane agonizes over them in heart-wrenching fashion. As in life, the standards one chooses to live by can be difficult to maintain.This defining tension is what drives the novel, but that it is delivered in such a skillful and assured way is what raises it to its lofty status. The dialogue, particularly, is fantastic. It is the stuff of an actor's dream: much of it can be interpreted in several different ways. Jane describes Rochester as being moody and tempestuous, and he often is, but at the same time--particularly after Jane agrees to marry him--he is hilariously wry and bemused. Jane comes across as being earnest and pleading, but she can be very playful and is often flirtatious. As mentioned above, these are deep, achingly human characters.The setting is also very evocative. The English countryside, class system and moral understanding were obviously familiar to those who read the book in Ms. Bronte's day, and probably familiar to many of us in this day and age. Nevertheless, Ms. Bronte took the time to document these things carefully. The descriptions of Rochester's home, the lanes in front if it and its orchards and fields; the destitute and grimly cold school for girls; and the small country town where Jane makes the acquaintance of a small group of benefactors towards the end of the novel are all a testament to life as it existed at this distant time and age.The novel is looked upon as a classic and should be. Ms. Bronte not only created a beautiful piece having to do with the nature of love--personal to her but universal in nature--but did so in such a spectacular way that she actually makes the reader feel this love, both for her creation, and for her.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Fantastic! Loved it!,"This turned out to be an exceptional book though I didn't think so in the beginning. By what seems the hundredth page, I had decided it was a feminine version of David Copperfield but not as interesting. By the hundred and fiftieth page, I was completely discouraged and was sure it had turned into the very romantic mush I detest (a lot of what she feels about him and what he feels about her, and so on). Somewhere soon after that, I fell in and was absorbed. It became a tremendously good book with a fantastic plot and a good pace. I read for hours and hours at a sitting enjoying every single minute of it and only stopped when something absolutely forced me. Excellent, excellent!Jane Eyre is an orphaned child under the guardianship of her maternal aunt. Not liked by her aunt and not able to get along with her cousins, Jane is sent to Lowood School for the children of the poor (it is a charity school) to be taught the fundamentals and, more importantly, to be conditioned for a life of poor expectations. Lowood changes the strong willed, impetuous Jane into a woman of uncommon restraint. When she accepts a post as governess to Adele at Thornfield Hall, she attracts the attention of Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who has the desire to reclaim himself from a sordid past. He comes to believe that Jane has the power to transform him and help him to realize himself in the better light that he has not heretofore been able to achieve on his own. But his secrets are not far away and peculiar events at Thornfield make the reader question his advances. Sworn not to ask about who or what is in the room on the third floor, Jane's iron resolve begins to falter with the dreamlike romance and the reader begins to trepiditiously hope for her happiness. When Mr. Rochester is unable to keep his past under wraps, however, Jane is forced onto a path that will require all of her internal resources to survive but will ultimately put her in the position to make choices for herself rather than just choose among available options. The question is, with her conditioning, can she lead with her heart instead of her head?My only legitimate greivance, and given only in the vein of humour, is that is seems like Jane would have taught Adele some English. The child speaks only in French and myself not being able to read French, I did not understand anything the child ever said. Luckily, her exuberance and intent still comes through and the reader can develop a softness for the child without understanding her dialogue.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Abridged :(,"I will agree that this performance is given with sensitivity to the voice of Jane Eyre and of Charlotte Bronte, but alas it's an abridged version. The above listing does not give any indication of this, consequently I was very disappointed when it arrived. I personally have no use for abridged books. When I pick up a book (print or audio) I want to experience the entire book. Abridged books always leave me feeling cheated, wondering what did I miss?",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,a young woman's book that transcends feminism and dogma,"I first read this book when I was ten and reread it every decade as a special treat to myself. It is one of the great classics of English literature. It is, essentially, a Cinderella story, and I STRONGLY recommend it as an andidote to the Woman-Hear-Me-Roar (or is it &quot;Girl Power&quot;?) stuff being pushed on young ladies nowadays as a means to making the sex strong. The story begins when the heroine, Jane Eyre, is a young orphan of about nine, and follows her through school and her career as a governess in a wealthy but mysterious man's home. She falls in love, learns of an impediment to her immediate gratification, does the right thing and suffers for her pains, but in the end is rewarded for her suffering. Very irrelevant to the late twentieth century, obviously. Charlotte Bronte (the author) is frquently encountered around the same time in life one encounters Dickens--youth--but, like Dickens, she most definitely wrote for adults. Therefore, the book is probably a difficult read for all but the most tenacious middle schooler, but as it begins from the very real, very painful point of view of a powerless child, it has a good hook to draw in the young reader. Its literary style is Romantic, with the liberal use of semi-colons, inverted sentences, and detailed descriptions. This book is a MUST for all well-educated young ladies--the next step after Little Women and before the Jane Austen novels. And sorry for the gender stereotyping; I'm sure there are boys and men out there who read this book and loved it, but I never met one.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Beautiful Love Story,"I recently saw a preview for a Jane Eyre movie soon to come out... and after having just gotten a Kindle, I thought I would read the book before I see the movie. A wonderful bonus... when I went to download it, it was free!Don't let the title of my review discourage you from reading it... This is a wonderful story--- more about overcoming horrible tribulations and finding peace and love through perseverance.The first page or two kind of threw me, as this novel was written in the mid 1800's. I was worried the language would make it too difficult to comprehend, but I was wrong. By the third page I was hooked, and hardly put it down the next 3 days until I finished it. This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go, even after you've finished it. It is definitely one of those novels that leaves you wanting more of these people. It is so well written, you feel submersed into their world-- and can picture every detail with great clarity, and feel every emotion.My only regret with this book is that I never read it till now. Wonderful, wonderful book!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Bold New vision...,"I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet,I'm rating the movie-tie in edition not the story its self.Now with Jane Eyre being my #1 favorite book of all time, I'm very excited about the new adaptation coming out next month. I thought this movie tie-in edition would be worth picking up, since it's suppose to have a ton of extras including the story behind the story, John Maynard on Jane's sexual awakening, John G. Peters on Jane's otherness etc(Which I found listed in the table of contents on bn.com). The extras and the nice cover were my only reasons for buying it, seeing as I already own a copy of the Barnes & Noble classics version of the book.Now to my surprise and disappointment all the extras that I looked forward to reading seemed to be jam packed into two pages and not really all that interesting.But there is hope,if you buy the ebook version you get a copy of the screenplay by Moira Buffini(Which is why it gets 4 stars). In my opinion after reading the screenplay it is worth the $6.36 and a nice treat for those of us who are impatiently awaiting the release for this bold new vision on Jane.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"We ""Feel"" Jane More Than We ""See"" Rochester","No one reads JANE EYRE for the plot or for the fine sense of irony that her sister Emily Bronte showed. They do read Charlotte Bronte for how she overcomes an admitted use of heavy-handed Gothic romanticism that includes all the traditional trappings of gloomy castles, Byronic satanic heroes, crazed prisoners, and even a shrieking telepathic message. If JANE EYRE had no more than these Gothic trappings, then it is not likely that I, or anyone else for that matter, would be discussing its literary merits. What sets Jane EYRE apart for its earlier and more heavy-handed predecessors was a sense of palpable realism that rings true with events that harken back to Charlotte Bronte's life that ran parallel with that of Jane Eyre's. This realism stems from experiences that Charlotte had in a school that was perilously close to Dickens' school in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY and Jane's school in Lowood. Further, the mistreatment that Jane underwent at Gateshead Hall must have originated from similar such savageries in her early youth. It is a tribute to Charlotte Bronte's realism that she could make her readers feel the pathos and sentimentalism of an outraged childhood.When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,must have!,"Jane Eyre is a powerful story of struggle and of love. Jane lives a difficult early life, and struggles to find a place just right for her to settle down. She starts out living with an emotionally abusive aunt and cousins who do not understand her. From there she is shipped to boarding school, where she is a student and later becomes a teacher. Here she is always hungry, and living conditions are not the best. Jane then becomes a governess for a little girl in a home called Thornfield Hall. It is here where she begins a somewhat strange and unconventional relationship with the master of her house, Mr. Rochester. The love that develops between them goes against all of the conventions of their time, and is almost lost. The last part of the book is beautiful and well fitting with the rest of the story.Charlotte Bronte uses amazing, flowing language that in itself makes the book terrific. Her story is full of a wide range of emotions. It is not a difficult read, but really gets your mind thinking. This is a classic, timeless novel that will have people engaged for ages. Have your pen ready to mark some of Bronte's beautiful passages that will be unforgettable!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"This summer, as I was searching for a free-choice book to read, I stumbled upon Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs. It was an overall great read!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Changed My Life,"I never thought myself the type to write a review for a book, but Jane Eyre presents itself as an exception. After reading the review below by a ""teenager"" I felt I, also being a teenager, must add a good word for this book, and for the teens out there who don't whine to their teachers when they try to share something great. I was 11 when I read Jane Eyre for a school book report of our choosing and was the first ""real"" book I ever read. It is the book that changed my gaze from the television screen to the written page. To this day, I prefer a book over a TV show any day, and I am 19. If it can do that for an 11 year old, I'm sure you will enjoy it too.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Without A Doubt The Best Novel Ever Written,"I read Jane Eyre for my AP Lit. Class in the 12th grade. I figured, oh just another boring book. WOW! was I completely mistaken. ALthough long, Jane Eyre could have been 1,000 pages and I still would have read every page, with joy. The growth Jane Eyre, the novels main character and Protagonist, goes through throughout the novel is amazing. Born into an unloving world, with rejection and anger at every corner, Jane is forced to keep herself company and therefore, her only friend is herself. Adopted by her uncle, who soon dies, Jane is forced to live with her aunt Reed. I dont want to summarize about all this stuff, I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. The novel mainly centers around Jane and her love for Rochester. When Jane becomes eighteen, she is hired to govern at the mansion of Rochesters, and to guide and teach his daughter, Adele. The marvelous love story between Jane and Rochester is as intense as anything you will ever read. At times while reading the novel, I would have to put the novel down and take in what I was reading. The passion and heart exhibited by these two characters was at times unbearable. If you want to read a true novel, full of power and emotion, read Jane Eyre- the best novel ever written. :-)",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,This deserves 105 stars!!!!!,"I chose to read this novel over my spring break and it turned out that reading it was about the only thing I could do. Upon picking up the gargantuan book I was a bit wary of the read, but after reading the first paragraph I was enchanted and further lured on. Bronte did a wonderful - no - fascinating job of creating such a strong, honest, and demanding character as Jane Eyre. Even as an orphaned child, in the care of her abhored aunt Reed, Jane displays such an immense amount of passion and creativity. These characteristics are further refined and blended with a touch of integrity as Jane suffers through the ill-treatment and neglect that she receives at Lowood, a charity school that Mrs. Reed sends her to so to be corrected of her faults. After having spent nearly eight years enduring the ghastly conditions of Lowood, Jane leaves her old life behind so to fill the position of governess at Thornfield Hall. During here stay at the mansion, she is confronted by something she has been completely ignorant of before - love. Her dark and strong, though not handsome, master, Mr. Rochester, causes a hearty seed to implant itself within the unmoving foundation of her soul. This seed of love flourishes and intertwines Jane's emotion's with those of beloved Mr. Rochester. Though love is said to withstand and conquer all, a mysterious and horrifying obstacle challenges the bond that has developed between Jane and Mr.Rochester. As the battle is carried out, Jane's soul and destiny are both tried and tested, thus forming a truly moving and unforgetable novel. Charlotte Bronte's writing is one of intense passion - not just the violent emotion of love, but that of faithfulness and devotion to ones' self and to others. As you travel from page to page of Jane Eyre's life, you will be forced to take into consideration your own character and moral values. Although it was a rather extented read, I do not regret for one moment the time I spent indulging myself in this enticing piece of profound literature. I sincerely believe that all who take on the task of reading this novel will benefit by it in one aspect of their life or another.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am Jane Eyre,"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Great book, not recommended for required school reading","I cringe as I read the reviews here that were written by children who were forced to read this in school. I can imagine feeling similarly if I had to trudge through this very long, mature novel with its outdated language and flowery descriptions as a teenager. However, as an adult, I loved the book. I do think it is overly long and could have done without some of the passages that describe the scenery. The best parts of this book are in Jane's elaborate, vivid thoughts and her interactions with the various people she meets. In a book that is less good, I would've taken away a star for the excessive scenic descriptions, but the best things about this book make up for that.Since there are already hundreds of reviews up here that go into what the story is about, I won't bother. What I will say is I am not generally a sentimental nor easily moved person, but I found this story very moving. I don't know if I'd recommend it to many men, and I'd probably not recommend it to anyone under 24. As an adult woman who spends much of her time lost in thought and doesn't always follow the most obvious path, I found it to be an excellent, engaging, and emotional read and am very glad I stuck with it until the end.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""Destiny""","There are many excellent books written about the human heart, but few writers master the artistry needed to combine both thought and dialog into a free flowing story that, filled with mystery and torment, capture the imagination as does Charlotte Bronte's tale of love and desire struggling upstream against the elements of life station, society's pressure, and mistakes made in youth that never lie in peace no matter how much time passes.Such is the novel Jane Eyre. I knew it was a Classic, and acknowledged it; I had seen several versions of the movies made of it, but did not recall having ever read the book as an adult. Written in 1847, it seemed something to watch on film, but not explore in the written word, as many such novels are difficult to read. Nothing could have been farther from the truth, and I was given an extraordinary literary experience once again by chance. It is particularly interesting given that this book was written by a woman at a time when license was thin; she managed not only to pull it off, but gave up nothing in the process while taking the reader to the smoldering destiny of what she intended to deliver.Jane Eyre is a hauntingly beautiful tale of a plain but highly mature and intelligent girl, shunned and unwanted by her family in her youth, much like the fairy tale of Cinderella. The reason for this travesty is finally delivered in the epilogue, yet it's integral importance yields completely to the unlikely romance that she finds as a result of it.She, frightened and alone but possessed of a courage and confidence that she will somehow prevail against her odds, is arranged a position as a governess for a mysterious, often absent gentleman of means who needs a tutor for his little girl. Upon arriving, she immediately senses there is a sinister intrigue surrounding the big house and it's inhabitants, but is too conscious of her place to be too inquisitive; beyond that, her sense of honor and integrity prevents any covert investigation on her part. But it is a place to flee from on occasion, and one night she leaves to send a letter out in the next town, which is a long walk through a dusky, cold winter's evening. There, on a lonely bridle path, she unwittingly meets the owner of the Estate, Edward Rochester - as he returns homeward, although in no glamorous way to be sure, as he has fallen off his horse and sprained his leg, all within her immediate vision. She come to his aid, helps him to his feet; and the first of the fateful encounters between a world-weary yet vital man and a much younger, guileless, yet very capable woman has come to be.The author waxes splendid in her descriptive paragraphs of the countryside and surroundings; of the morning mist shrouding the walks under the cherry trees in the old gardens surrounding the mansion; of moonlight shining in windows at night adding visuals as if by magic. But that's the periphery; the undercurrent of something else is running dark and deep. There is a secret hidden on the upper story, one that is closely guarded, yet threatens to expose itself continually, with the potential to destroy not only Mr. Rochester himself, but any chance for happiness he may decide to take.Rochester senses something out of the ordinary in the governess he has inherited by chance to educate and care for his child. The flighty little girl is the irritating and very tangible link to his past that brings him continual reminders of his ""error"" - yet has somehow been the vessel that brings about his emotional emancipation - through the hiring of Jane. And as Jane becomes acquainted with her benefactor, she realizes that despite his eccentricities, he is above other men in many, many ways, for even in her protected environment she has noticed his encouragement of equality for her; encouragement to speak her mind and reveal her thoughts to him. She is reluctant to do so, because she is wary of the differences in station between them, and realizes he has ultimate and enduring power over her. He cleverly attempts to seek out and determine ahead of time each of his moves toward his desires so that he may emerge to the next level unscathed.The idea flow is exquisite; articulate without a misstep anywhere in connecting her intricate plot with the characters and the moments that filter unerringly down to create the mood and the sensuality between the two unlikely lovers that are caught up in the vortex. The night the Gypsy arrives unbidden to the big house is a perfect example.The scene Jane endures with the ""gypsy"" in the parlor is truly one of a kind; I don't believe I have ever read anything quite it's equal for astonishing originality. The depth of emotional insight, passion, and fear of rejection and/or discovery is intensely woven into this particular part of the story in an unforgettable exchange of dialog and mental dueling; a subtle, ingenious breaking of barriers, of discovery without risk.Turn charlotte Bronte loose with word software on a computer with the literary license of today and one can't help but wonder just what form it would have taken. For certain though, it could not have been more masterfully written than was the ""original.""",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Reader, I finally read it and you should too.","I've seen meritorious film adaptations of JANE EYRE but never got around to actually reading the book until now. What I found was a strong-willed story that moves like a high-speed freight-train even in some long-winded passages. In the tradition of the best 19th century English fiction, the book possesses a sharp social eye, tinkers with narrative technique for great effect, endows settings with a character all their own, and deploys verbal and dramatic irony with abandon. It tells a whopper of a romance between two extraordinary people from the perspective of the title character, who survives every kind of hardship life has to throw her way but who never loses herself, even when she falls for Mr. Wrong-and-Right-at-the-same-time.This book must have knocked the socks off early Victorian England. Our heroine goes to great lengths to establish that she and Mr. Wrong/Right do not conform to the beauty standards of their world, and yet they are most attractive characters. Jane insists on being the captain of her fate, no subserviance to men, not even the one she loves. Mr. Wrong/Right who is no angel is still sympathetic. Probably the most startling theme Bronte sounds countermands her generation's zeigeist: don't marry for money, security and respectability, go for the soulmate no matter the cost. This is pretty bold stuff for the daughter of a clergyman.I won't get into the plot because the danger of spoilers lies in every twist. I will say that one of its climatic points bequeathed me a nightmare, such is the writer's spell. The film adaptations by their very nature cannot convey the written voice and by necessity they must conflate some characters and events to accommodate the flow of action. Watch the Orson Welles or the recent PBS version, both of which are nifty, but don't substitute them for the book, especially if you have to write a book report or pass a test on it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"Any reader that enjoys cuddling up with a romantic novel should definitely read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale.

As it's so long, the class only had to read half of it, but I felt compelled to read the rest at home as I really felt for the character, and I felt like I'd just die if I didn't find out what happens to her! That's what defines any good book: only if the reader is made to feel for the characters can they be interested enough to take in the issues raised in the novel. I usually find that novels that are fun to read, about characters that readers warm to, are generally superficial, whereas novels involving two-dimensional characters contain relevent and worthwhile morals and issues for us to dwell on. Thats what defines Jane Eyre as a classic; it has the best of both worlds.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A brief overview of Jane Eyre.,"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is a book that reveals, the complexities of a woman's mind, her struggle for independence and her search for a separate identity. It is a journey beginning with the innocence of a young girl, an orphan, and unfolds to show us the growth of the female protagonist in her search for an identity, helping us to see the world through her eyes.Bronte's style of writing is such, that the confusion and bewilderment young Jane feels is palpable, as is her hunger to be loved and the hurt she feels, on being ill-treated. The novel cannot be called an autobiography, but many of the incidents that go into the making of the novel have been taken from the life of the author. There is also an element of the supernatural, which appealed greatly to the readers of the time but does not invoke the same response today.The book also gives us an insight into the age in which the author wrote. The position of women, in the society or rather the lack of it. The portrayal of Rochester's wife in the attic at Thornfield can be interpreted as the darker side of Jane's personality. The part of her that she suppresses after being locked in the ""Red Room"" at the Reed mansion. Mad bertha is that part of Jane that she has to lock away in order to be accepted in a stifling and prudish Victorian society.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Not far from Charles Dickens.,"Well, I can't call Charlotte Bronte another Marlowe, Shakespeare, or Dickens. But what I will call her is a very close runnerup. Bronte masterfully shows us a young girl's growth in an abusive environment to a mature an admirable woman. The images are deep and convincing. The scene where Jane forgives her abusive aunt is very touching and memorable. Bronte also strikes us with the complex Rochester. Perhaps Bronte's greatest accomplishment is how she makes Jane such a Christ like figure. It is interesting that this novel came out in 1847. It is also possible to wonder if this work inspired Charles Dickens' masterpiece &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850).",positive

I do NOT think the woman in the attic (Bertha, Rochester's first wife) is a lunatic. I think her actions, although violent, are justified (ripping Jane's veil to shreds- She doesn't want her husband marrying another woman while she is locked in the attic). Though this review appears negative, I really did like the book. I, too, was assigned this as an AP English reading assignment (as JACKIE from Rotterdam, NY), and I am glad I was assigned it, for had I not been, I might not have ever read the timeless story of thencredible heroine, Jane Eyre.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,"Good story, but TOO many details","I was assigned to read Jane Eyre for school, but I did not realize that it would take me forever to read! Although many disagree, I think that Jane goes into too much detail about every single thing that goes on in her life. We could understand the story and enjoy the themes of it without reading so many detailed descriptions of unimportant things! Overall, I would recommend this book to people, but I would suggest to skip the things that do not seem important.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"a beautiful, heart-warming, heroic story for ages to come","I just finished reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for my grade twelve English class. I borrowed the book from my school library. About four chapters into the book, I returned the novel to the library, and went out that night to get my own copy.I cannot express in words how this novel has touched my heart. The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront. I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,The free Kindle version is fine...,"The free Kindle version is fine if you aren't reading the book for study purposes and if you know a tiny hint of French. In fact, I'm of the opinion that reading 160+ year old books on Kindle has the distinct advantage of access to the built-in English dictionary. You can look up archaic words immediately without losing your page, thanks to the 'back' button. I didn't mind the fact that there were no page breaks between chapters as one previous reviewer did. In fact the novel was so gripping and compelling that the very fact that there were even chapters to break it up left me feeling somewhat impatient!The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 probably has more to do with Kindle books in general rather than this book in particular. It reads as easily as any other book I've read on Kindle. But it's the kind of novel where you want to flip back to a certain section and re-read a portion just because of what is currently being said by the characters, and there is no way to do that. As for the French passages I had mentioned earlier, they are really very few in number and even if you don't know any French, don't let it stop you from reading this novel. They're all things said by one character or another, often repeated in English. (Thank you, Charlotte Bront)! None of it is important to the plot or to the characters themselves.Charlotte Bront shows herself to be an incredibly masterful writer in ""Jane Eyre."" There were times when I just stopped to admire the style with which she conveyed something and the techniques she used. She is also incredibly insightful into human nature. The main character is an introverted person and all of her thoughts, beautifully laid out, make her into one of the most compelling characters in literature. Although it may be difficult to see this, I do think that the author was showing her feminist colors, such as they were in those days, when she conjured up Jane Eyre.Thanks for making these classic books available for free on Kindle!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Considered a literary masterpiece for a reason; or, A magnificent tale of unrequited love, and so much more","As much as I know this is a classic, and I feel a review a tad redundant, I've just read the magnificent Jane Eyre for the first time, and I'm so utterly enamoured, I simply must wax poetic about it a while!Where to start. I've just finished reading Charlotte Bront's Gothic masterpiece for the first time, and I feel a mixture of breathless and speechless.Chronicling the life of the orphaned Jane Eyre, the novel begins with a truly upsetting account of what can only be called horrific child abuse. We encounter Jane as she strikes back at her childhood tormentor--her cousin John--for the first time, after quietly enduring teasing, beating, and the hatred of her only family (her dead uncle's wife, and her 3 cousins) for the whole of her short 10 years. As punishment, she is confined to the 'Red Room', the room in which her uncle died. As the sun sets, and she's left in darkness, the terrified child has a panic attack, and her aunt advantageously uses the event to have Jane sent away to Lowood School--a change of scene to save her nerves.We watch Jane grow into a passionate young woman, develop self-respect, a distaste for injustice, and her own strong sense of right and wrong. After completing her education, and working two years at Lowood as a teacher, Jane hungers for a new situation in life, so advertises in the paper, and is invited to take up a post as governess for a child, at a wealthy, private residence. Here we experience part spooky mystery, part love story, and see the world of Thornfield Manor through fiery and fascinating Jane's eyes.Jane Eyre is many things--a journey of self discovery, a love story, and a surprisingly progressive tale for its day. It holds some strongly feminist ideas, or perhaps more than feminist, ideas about justice, class systems, and equality. It's Jane, a relative 'commoner' who shows more backbone and self-respect than many of her high-bred 'superiors'. Social standing, graces, and superficial manners all come second to intelligence, self-respect, actually having character, and one's own mind.It's mentioned--and constantly reiterated that neither Jane, nor her suitor, are physically much to look at. The idea of true beauty coming from within, and beauty being in the eye of the beholder is another strong theme here. Jane as a character is in strong contrast with others, such as the beautiful, yet shallow and capricious Georgiana Reed, or cruel and superficial Blanche Ingram. Where these women are admired in the highest regard in their upper class society, despite their lack of character, Jane is despised, but she is the better human being. I love that she KNOWS it, also.We're also presented with a wonderful array of unique and colourful characters, very few of whom seem black and white. Rochester, most obviously, struggling to justify his actions before God and society, every bit as much as to his own self; wanting to be good, wanting to be a better man, but really--let's be honest--failing. He's resigned to the fact he can't be better without outside influence. We have a role reversal here: rather than our male hero being a knight in shining armour to a damsel in distress, Rochester views Jane as his saviour. Then characters like Bessie: sweet, but with a temper that will turn as quickly as the wind. She's neither good, nor bad. The adorable, but admittedly vapid, Mademoiselle Ad&egrave;le, and above all Jane, who lives by her own rules and sense of morality, rather than those of society... and really, who's are better, here?. There are still clich&eacute;s here, though. The lunatic wife, the wicked stepmother and stepsisters (In the shape of aunt and cousins)... But at the time, were these clich&eacute;s at the time this was written?Amidst all the romance and wonderful characters, it's easy to forget the wonderful gothic thriller/mystery at the heart of Thornfield, and for anyone new to the story, its heartbreaking conclusion. And the romantic tension between Jane and Rochester? It's as palpable--if not more so--than any modern romance I've read (here's looking at you Twilight), but for once we're dealing with a girl with backbone. This is nothing like a Jane Austen love story. We're not dealing with manners and moving within the bounds of acceptable society--this is unrequited love, people.On an aside, for those who've readA Room of One's Own (Annotated), and Wolfe's criticism of both Charlotte Bront and Jane Eyre, it's interesting to see parallels between the two works: that a woman doesn't need a man to define her; that having one's own means is essential for any woman who wants to create (or maintain an independent mind); that it's the value of human being's heart and mind--not outward appearances--that is what gives them value (I'm thinking about Judith and William Shakespeare, here). Jane is every bit as good as Mrs and the Misses Reeds, the Ingrams, and indeed, a number of the men of this book. She is the intellectual equal of Rochester, and perhaps superior of St John, regardless of her sex.Despite the time since it was written, Jane Eyre is not hard to read. I often struggle with older novel but it's far easier than Dracula, which was an effort for me, though not necessarily a good comparison. It's hugely entertaining, in parts absolutely heartbreaking, and there is a good reason why it remains popular, and a 'classic' over a hundred years later. It's an extraordinary work of fiction, beautifully written, and with just as much to enjoy now as it did when it was first published.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Yearning to Read Review,"Jane Eyre, a girl of no importance and the daughter of an unapproved match, lives a troubled life for her first ten years under her aunt's roof. Her parents died when she was a baby and she was left as Aunt Reed's charge with no other living relatives that she knew of. When her aunt can no longer stand Jane any more, she sends her to a boarding school where the rules are strict and the headmaster is every bit the tyrant Aunt Reed was. But Jane conquers, becomes a teacher, and then wishes to become a private tutor. After her ad is received and her application accepted, Jane finds herself in the home of a mysterious and strange man, Mr. Rochester, who has put his ward, Adele, under Jane's tutelage. But then Jane finds herself falling deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, who she could not imagine would love her in return. This, and the strange happenings in Thornfield Hall, give Jane cause to doubt her future. And when Mr. Rochester's dark secret reveals itself, Jane must question her love and discover what she must do with her life before she can find the happiness she never had.____________________________________This is one of those ""Can words describe?"" books. And while I feel there aren't very many words that do an adequate job, I will try my best.Can you believe that I haven't read this book yet? I can't. For years, people have been telling me, ""Sierra, you have to read this book."" ""Sierra, this is one of the best books I've ever read."" ""Oh my GOSH! You haven't read Jane Eyre?!"" ""What are you waiting for, you, the reader, of all people?""So here I am, having read (devoured) the long awaited book that has been loved, cried and giggled over by hordes. And I'm here to tell you people who have not yet read this book - ""What. In the world. Are. You. Waiting for?!"" (I know...I'm one to talk...but now I know how everyone else feels! haha!)Throughout the course of the book, I got choked up. But there was too much ahead to slow down, stop, and actually cry. However...when I got to the last chapter, I lost it. Tears came and the two-year-old little boy I was babysitting put down his yogurt and stared at me, head cocked to the side, probably completely confused as to why I was smiling and crying at the same time. After all the heartache and sadness, and even the little bits of joy in between, the happiness of the end just overwhelmed me. It was just too beautiful to not feel that way - there was so much emotion in my heart that I felt it would almost burst.Jane is a character I look up to - I want to be like her. Her decisiveness, her courage, her resolution, her faith...it amazed me, and amazes me still, even after the book has been set back on the shelf. She knew what she had to do and she did it - no matter the cost. And the way she loved everyone so unconditionally - especially Mr. Rochester - continually surprised me. Her kind heart, her gentle but firm manner, and her intense love... Wow. I also loved her close study of human nature and how she described and saw people - why she was intrigued by them.Mr. Rochester himself is quite a character. Going into this story, I was NOT expecting him to be the least like he was - physically ugly and mentally independent. He was strange, but yet so perfect for the story. In all my travels through literature, I've never met a character like him, and I doubt I ever will again. That character will always be embodied by Mr. Rochester alone. I easily fell for him as Jane did; her love for him was pure; she never once judged him for his faults; she loved him all the more for them. The reader cannot help but feeling the same. I loved seeing his pride break down, slowly but surely, and the way he described the experience after. It was just amazing.As far as the story line and the writing... Both were equally magnificent. The story captured me from the first, especially when I expected the novel to begin when she was older. But I loved every bit of it - every second was glorious, and painful and lovely. I cared for Jane so much that it didn't matter what she was doing - I wanted to read about her. And Mr. Rochester and St. John and Adele and everyone else. The writing was incredible, down to the very last word. I loved how she wrote most of the time in past tense, and then sometimes slipped smoothly into present tense, showing the reader exactly what it felt like, to be doing instead of remembering. I'm actually not a huge fan of present tense, but this was so perfect I just couldn't resist liking it.Favorite character: Mr. Rochester because of his originality...and how much I loved his character within the first few pages of his introduction.Favorite aspect: DUH! The love story, of course! Totally intriguing the way it was played out, the intensity of Mr. Rochester's secret hanging over it part of the time, the rest being Jane's own doubts about Mr. Rochester's nature or her sadness over him being engaged to a woman who would not and could not love him - and who he had no passion for either. Oh my gosh this story had me in its clutches and didn't let me go!!!There are no single words to describe this book. Magnificent and heart-pounding and gut-wrenching are about the best I can do. They are true - as true as true can be - but there is something about the book that can only be felt and understood by reading it yourself. It's not anything that can be described - it's an experience. One that I can't wait to relive again and again and again!!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A True Classic,"I remember watching the movie as a young girl and how the story never really left me. I was not dissappointed in the book at all.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,"The book is good (but not great), the introduction and notes are atrocious","*** This is a review of the Penguin Classic version with Rebecca Solomon's ""The Governess"" on the cover, with introduction and notes by Michael Mason ****** SPOILER ALERT ***First, the book. I'd give it 3.5 stars. I think it is a well written autobiography of a poor, plain but fiercely independent girl. You do feel sympathy for that girl and her moral and emotional struggle. However, there are some elements in this book that I do not like:1. The author's constant addressing of the ""reader"" is just peculiar. Most part of the book is written in first person voice, but every now and then she felt the urge to pause and remind the ""reader"" (thus switching to second person), this rather takes the reader out of the flow of the narrative. I personally do not like this.2. The two main male characters are wholly unlikable, even repulsive. Rochester comes across as a rude, sullen, selfish, deceptive and manipulative character. On the last point, I am referring to the episode of him, in order to arouse Jane's jealousy, pretending to have fallen in love with another prettier girl. And of course much can be said about his deceptiveness and selfishness. It is indeed hard to understand why Jane would fall for this guy, except that he is really the very first male person she encounters in the real world. As to St. John Rivers, he is simply a religious nutcase, all he talks about is his missionary work, showing no human compassion to even his own sisters. Yet, although Jane eventually rejects him, the author pains him in a saintly aura.3. The constant references to scripture is really irksome.Nonetheless, I do think the personality of the main character is believable and depicted vividly, that's why I would give it 3.5 stars (good but not great).Now on the introduction and notes by Michael Mason, I think they are atrocious. First in the introduction he arrogantly suggests that the general reader cannot ""get"" serious literature, only professional critics like him holds the canonical interpretation (I paraphrase). Here's news to Mr. Mason: we have a brain and we can think for ourselves too, thank you very much. But if the introduction is mildly annoying, the notes are just ridiculous. There are chunks of conversation in the book in French, but he never bothers to translate them; however he *constantly* FORWARD-references plot elements. For example, before we find out who Rochester's maniac wife is, he already mentions her name and what she's going to the next day; at another point when Jane had a dream about Thornfield on fire, he says something like ""considering what happened next, this is so accurate that it is like a 'second vision'"" (I paraphrase again). This is called ""RUINING THE BOOK"", as some other reviewer said (I believe he or she was referring to Mason's notes), this is like an annoying friend constantly telling you what's going to happen next when you watch a movie. This is so frustrating at times I wish Mr. Mason was standing next to me so I can whack him with the book (and shove his ""canonical view"" of serious literature down his throat).",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Jane Eyre is a strong protagonist, but this book should be read later in life","Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: ""I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist."" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too ""fairy tale"" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of ""blindness"" in the novel. First, he is ""blind"" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: ""He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge.."" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a ""plain"" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get ""stuck in the mud"", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,What a protagonist! What prose! What a book!,"Jane Eyre is book #6 on theThe Well-Educated Mind's list of must-read novels, and it immediately draws comparison to the two prior selections,Pride and PrejudiceandOliver Twist. Both Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre were written by female authors and feature strong female protagonists. Elizabeth Bennett and Jane Eyre are both very feisty and committed to finding romantic love in a time when that wasn't always the basis for marriages. The major difference between the two books, though, is that Pride and Prejudice is far more subtle, with the ""action"" taking place largely within the lead character's thoughts and emotions, while a whole lot of exciting, external action happens in Jane Eyre. That's not to say one is better than the other, only that they are different in this way while being somewhat similar in overall theme.Like Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre is an orphan. ""Luckily"" for her, though, she wasn't abandoned to a work house but adopted by a well-to-do uncle. I say ""luckily"" in quotes because the uncle dies when she's one (this isn't a spoiler, I promise) and she's then left in the care of her hateful aunt, who shows her no love or mercy for the ten years Jane lives with her. Jane is the victim of vicious beatings at the hands of her older cousin John, too. But the difference between her and Oliver Twist is that she fights back -- she's spunky, not just a miserable sad sack like Oliver (I hated that character and the entire book). When her aunt says that Jane is unfit to associate with her cousins, Jane shots back ""They're unfit to associate with me!"" When asked by a preacher what she needs to do to avoid going to Hell, Jane says, ""I must keep in good health, and not die.""The level of abuse young Jane suffers is far less onerous than that of Oliver, and therefore more believable. She inhabits a world of realistic characters, not stereotypes. I felt bad for Jane; I just rolled my eyes and said ""Oh brother"" whenever Oliver was absurdly mistreated.But Jane doesn't stay a child in the story for long -- soon enough she's an adult young woman with new kinds of problems. And of course, she falls in love... The love-story component of this book is probably the best I've ever read, and there are a few chapters composed solely of dialog between two lovers that are absolutely beautiful to read. This IS, however, an action-oriented story, and the plot is both believable and engaging. The story is well-paced, too: Twice when I felt things were just beginning to get a bit tedious there were abrupt changes of scenery that kept me tuned in. I loved this book! While not quite as good asGulliver's Travelsor Pride and Prejudice, this might just be the third best novel I've ever read.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Romance for the ages,"Published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currier Bell, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has definitely become a timeless classic. Even now, over 150 years after its debut, Jane Eyre's popularity amongst scholars and avid readers has not wavered. However, nowadays, its use of old language and portrayal of a time long past has made it less appealing to the general public.Jane Eyre, the protagonist of the story, is an orphan cared by her aunt, whose whole family views her as an onerous responsibility pushed upon them at her uncle's deathbed. After a few incidents with her taunting cousins, Jane is shipped off to Lowood, a school run by a hypocritical minister. Despite the hardships she had to endure at Lowood, Jane graduates and eventually leaves Lowood to become a governess. At Thornhill, she meets and falls in love with her master, the cold and mysterious Mr. Rochester. However, when it seems that happiness is finally within reach, Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's dark secret that puts a halt to their relationship. But of course, due to her high morals and strong determination to stick to them, all ends well for Jane and Mr. Rochester.While this piece is a story of finding love and happiness, Bronte utilizes Jane's experiences (which are based partly off her experiences in school and as a governess) to criticize the inferiority with which women were viewed at the time. Although Jane is more educated, well-mannered, and morally superior to her master, her status is still considered far beneath his. The Rivers sisters is also representation of how Bronte feels women should be: poised, knowledgeable, and talented.It is no wonder that Charlotte Bronte is known for her ability to make characters and situations come alive. Bronte's vivid and lively narration makes Jane a loveable and relatable character. Through the details of her narration and the fitting syntax structure, her readers are able to clearly grasp the struggles, decisions, and dilemmas that Jane faces constantly. When Jane fought hunger and the cold at Lowood, when she choose to leave behind her ticket to ""happiness,"" when she came into inheritance at the Rivers's home and returned to Thornhill, Bronte took us with her. The imagery is also plenty and a great aid in visualizing the setting, especially the mysterious Thornhill.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Maybe it is because I am just a sucker for romances or maybe it is because I generally love historical fiction, but I did not agree with my peers when they said that the story was boring. I admit, the plot does become a bit dragged on at some points, like Jane's time at Lowood and her stay with the Rivers. Overall though, I still say that Jane Eyre is definitely one of my more favorite ones that I read last year.If you don't mind historical fiction and can get your head around the archaic diction, then I highly recommend Jane Eyre. Especially if you are a sucker for romances like me.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Model for the Modern Historical Romance,"It seems silly to say that a book can affect you on a profound level. well I definitely believe in this power that a good book has. Jane Eyre is one of them. I cannot say that this was an easy book to read. But it was a book that I was very enriched by reading. Romance is a genre that is looked down on by many ""sophisticated readers."" Perhaps they would look down on Jane Eyre, but would probably get some eyebrows raised at them. Well Jane Eyre is the archetype for the romance novel. After having read thousands of them, I know a romance novel when I see it, and Jane Eyre does qualify. But it is much more than this. It's a story for the person who wonders why the keep trying to do the right thing, and persevering in life, instead of just taking what they want when they want it. If Jane Eyre had been that sort of person, she would not have gotten her happy ending. Instead, Jane walked away from the thing she wanted most in the world. She almost died doing what she felt in her heart was right. Had the story ended there, I probably would have detested this book. But it doesn't. We see Jane continue to grow and act as the phenomenal person that she was. Although often downtrodden, she is no meek mouse. She has a fighting spirit that keeps her going when others would have laid down and died. But despite being a fighter, she is not a user and abuser. It's hard at times for the difference to be clearly delineated. Well there is no question about Jane's level of strength and intregrity. Although it is made clear several times in this novel, that Jane is no beauty, her soul makes her a beautiful character. Beautiful in a more profound way.There are moments when you feel, how can one person suffer so? But taking the journey, you realize that all Jane's suffering had a purpose. It refined her into a woman who could look beneath and love what others could never love or understand. It made her the woman who could love and heal Rochester.At the same time, Rochester was made for Jane Eyre. He had searched his life for a woman like her, and made quite a few mistakes along the way. And out of love, he was able to let her go when he wanted to keep her. But she came back to him, when he needed her most.Rochester is the hero that formed the archetype for many of my favorites: tortured, scarred, dark, enigmatic, all of those things. Best of all, loving little, plain, ordinary Jane with a fundamental intensity that pours out of the pages of this book into my heart as a reader. Despite his lack of perfection, I could not love him more.Ah, how maudlin I sound. I can't help it. This book moved me to tears. Yet I smiled at the same time. I enjoyed the conversations between Rochester and Jane. There was a heat there, a passion. Yet this book is clean enough to read in Sunday school. That is grand romance. The journey so well expressed, that no sex scenes are needed. It's all there.This novel is also inspirational. Not preachy, in my opinion, but for a believer, one can definitely find spiritual messages in this book. About perseverance, about not wearying about doing good. About the profoundness of God's love. It's all there, but in a narrative that expertly showcases it, not preaching it.I feel I am failing to write the review I want to write for this book. The words do fail me. All I can say is that this book will always be a favorite of mine because of the way it touched my heart and challenged me.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"&quot;To prolong doubt was to prolong hope.&quot; - Jane EyreHow true! This book displays an almost unusual scenario.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Romantic and sweet,"Romance and love. Principles and rash decisions. All these are included with much more in the edge-of-your-seat novel: Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte.The main character, Jane Eyre, is first pictured as a poor, neglected, mistreated ten-year-old. Her temper is yet wild and uncontrolled, so she gets into many scraps, consequentially landing her in a boarding school fifty miles away. After a bad epidemic of typhus, the unhealthy structure of Lowood school is discovered. It is at once put to rights.After eight years at Lowood (two total as a student and six as a teacher), Jane discovers that she longs for a different life. She puts an ad in the paper, and soon receives a letter from an old lady named Mrs. Fairfax. This lady writes to hire Jane as governess of a little French girl. Upon taking the job, Jane presently meets the owner of the house, Mr. Rochester, and falls in love. However, while at the altar, about to make their vows, a disruption occurs.Jane runs away with nothing but a few pounds, which she accidentally leaves in the coach. After three days out in the open with hardly any food or sleep, she encounters a happy family, which takes her in. Se doesn't give her true identification, but soon becomes at home and gets a job as the local girl's schoolmistress.However, not very long after, Jane meets a bend in the road. No sooner does she get settled in, but she finds that she does have family and a large fortune after all! She begins to feel restless and uneasy to have left Mr. Rochester, and sets out to find him.I won't say the ending, but I will say that I loved this book! It is so romantic and sweet. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Besides, ""they all lived happily ever after,"" and that's the best part.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A timeless romance,"Young Jane has a tough childhood growing up with her cousins and aunt after her parents passed away. Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Immediate Success,JANE EYRE is a wonderful story about a woman's struggle to survive and go on to realize her full potential. It is also a stirring tale of romance in which love conquers evil and despair.The plot is interesting while the main characters are multi-dimensional and very intriguing. The book has almost too many characters but some are memorable simply because they seem so real.The story begins with Jane Eyre as an unwanted orphan in the care of a cruel aunt who has two spoiled children of her own. Jane is sent to an austere boarding school where she develops into a remarkable young woman able to overcome tremendous obstacles and discouragements. She gets a job as a governess for a young girl at Thornfield which is owned by Edward Rochester. The evolving love relationship between Jane and Edward becomes the focus of the novel whose broad message is uplifting in spite of the sombre mood and tragic events which often intervene.I like Charlotte Bronte's writing style. It is easy to see why she became an immediate success with the publication of JANE EYRE in 1847.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"This book is probably my favorite that I have ever read. The story is about a young governess who grew up as a neglected orphan. When she moves to the home of Rochester, her life takes quite a turn. Charlotte Bronte's writing style is sound, engaging, and beautiful. The heroine is easy to relate to and displays a strong, ... character. This book is passionate, romantic, mysterious, exciting, and altogether wonderful! I highly recommend it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"A million dollar book, deserves a million stars!","Jane my hope,my love, my life.Charlotte is brilliant! Truly Brilliant!I love this book! It is a true romance.Charlotte realy out did herself. but if thisbook was any better, it would be worth a million dollars!The whole needs to read it.The #1 author,wrote the #1 book.P.S after you read this book, see the Zelah Clarke, and Timothy Daltom movie version, of Jane Eyre, not the Whilliam Hurt one.Thanks for Reading!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Five stars is not enough!,"I first read this book a year ago, and the second time it is even better. Jane is one of my favorite characters in literature. It is an incredible, beautiful story, one of the best ever written. Jane Eyre is a plain, unattractive, poor orphan. She goes through a difficult childhood, first in the house of her abusive aunt, then as a student who endures the harsh and unjust conditions of Lowood School. At eighteen, she takes up the post of governess at Thornfield Hall, meets and falls in love with Mr. Rochester, her employer.Despite the wrongs and harsh treatments she recieved as a girl, despite having no family and few friends, Jane at eighteen is strong, thoughtful and intelligent when her character meets the nasty and sarcastic Mr. Rochester. Their conversation is so full of wit, humour and hidden meanings. There is nothing more charming than how Mr. Rochester attempts to provoke Jane and tries to bully her a bit, but his efforts miserably fail as he finds he has met someone who is quite his equal. In her novel, Bronte stresses that their relationship is based on 'sympathy' and 'a likeness'.A dark secret of Rochester's past impedes their marriage, and after an emotional and heart-breaking scene, Jane adheres to her morals and leaves Thornfield in the night. What follows are two days of degredation, neglect, and pain, as Jane finds herself in an unfriendly town where none will help her. An unusual twist of fate brings salvation at last, in the form of the handsome St. John and his sisters. Again Jane's strength of character is tested when St. John (is it me, or is he a lot like Enjolras of Les Miserables?) makes her a difficult proposal. She has to make a final decision of either sacrificing her heart or seeking Rochester again.The novel is full of heart-warming moments, suspense and intrigue. The narrator, Jane herself, constantly addresses the reader, and makes you feel like you know her personally. Through this and the beautiful use of language I've found a friend and an idol in Jane. She is a wonderful character, and you come to realize she is not at all plain, she is interesting, complex, and passionate.When speaking of her Rochester says ""Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage...And it is you, spirit - with will and energy - and virtue and putiry - that I want: not alone your brittle frame.""Did I say the language is beauitful and thrilling? My copy of the book, although new, is quickly wearing out! Again and again I pick it up to read my favourite passages, which I've marked. Although I absolutely adore this book, I must say if you are not a fan of the genre and don't read classics, you might think it slow. But with some patience, your efforts will be rewarded. Read this book if you think yourself unlucky, Jane's courage and faith will inspire you.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A CLASSIC PIECE OF LITERATURE!,"When I was little, my mother would always read this to me. I was named after the writer, who my mother loved. This book is a classic. You must read this to be considered a true reader or &quot;book lover&quot;.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,FANTASIC BOOK,"This book is one of my favorite books of all time. It is well thoughout and the story line is well developed through the whole book. It is such an interesting story you will never get bored of it. I would highly recommend everyone to read this book if you enjoy an interesting, serious, and creative book!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,verrry verrry good!!!!,"this book made me laugh and made me cry. i cannot believe that she ran away...cant get over it. awesome, though. oh, and has anyone else noticed that on the front of the Dover Thrift edition it says that Jane Eyre is by Emily Bronte? anyone else notice that?...",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Another Bronte Masterpeice,"However lengthy, the pages go by quick when you read this book. It's an asorbing page turner, causing you to grunt and yell aloud at the stupidity and density the two main characters seem to live on. This is thee original romance novel; introducing you to memorable characters and plotlines. It's said to be gothic, and in a sweet, quaint way it is. The narrator is a plain girl, who has morals and lives by them(however much it makes you scream). The fancied is Edward Rochester, a genius in his own right, with brilliant plans. The hidden secret-- it's a shock. (Just don't let anyone tell you beforehand). This book gets five stars, because of all it contains (or, rather, because it leaves out nothing a great novel should have).",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Great Story,"I know, trite title for a review. I'm 14 and I just saw the play Jane Eyre. I immediately wanted to read the book (even if it was confusing and boring), and so I bought the only copy Borders had: the pinkish paperback one. I'm not even a third of the way through it, but it is SO great! It's not boring at all, it's clear, not confusing, and it's a terrific story! I would just recommend that you don't buy the paperback because it's really cheap paper and it'll rip easily. I recommend buying a hardcover copy that you can keep forever.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,This is a wonderful book!,"I read the book Jane Eyre once when I was in 5th or 6th grade (or possible the summer in-between...?) and I absolutely LOVED it. I read it again the summer after seventh grade (last summer) and I still love it just as much. It's one of those books that you can just read over and over and over....and you never get tired of it. Charlotte Bronte tells Jane's heartbreaking storing of being mistreated as a child and growing up into a shy, reserved young adult so well. I can see everything in the book happening as I read it. I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An unforgettable character,"One of the things that I liked most about ""Wuthering Heights"", by Charlotte Bronte's sister Emily, was the ""scenery"", the way in which the author conveyed a weather, an opressive environment, a climate of tension and impending doom. In Jane Eyre this too happens, but in a different way. For one thing, the characters move around more and it is not always foggy and rainy. You can actually see the novel like a film, and feel the damp air and the ominous silence.""Jane Eyre"" tells the story of a woman, since her childhood. The orphaned daughter of a poor Anglican priest, she goes to live with his uncle and aunt, but the man soon dies and she is left to live under the iron fist of the aunt, a horrible woman with horrible kids who torment Jane constantly. Of course, we get only her version, since the book is narrated in the first person. After an incident when Jane is left to terrorize in the ""red room"", where her uncle died and where she fears his ghost will appear, she gets out of control and sent to an orphanatory. A brief digresson is worth here: ever since she is a child, Jane shows enormous self-assurance and pride. Her strong character refuses to be mistreated, and she reacts even violently to injustice. Her personality will grow through the novel, giving her the endurance to sustain repeated blows of fate. So she goes to the orphanatory, where after a period of incredible suffering and mistreatment, she finds a home and a friend in one of the school teachers (a young woman). She becomes a teacher herself, and when she's 18 she feels the time to fly away has come, so she advertises in a newspaper as a tutor for children. She receives a positive answer and moves to a manor house far in the countryside, the typical Bronte scene in the moors. The job consists in teaching a young French girl, with whom she develops a strong, if not too intimate, bond. But, and it's a big but, there is a mystery. The girl is not (at least not legally) the manor's lord's daughter. He's not even there when Jane is hired. He's supposed to be a stern, unpredictable man near his forties called Mr. Rochester. Finally the man appears, and he and Jane slowly develop a strange relationship. He's initially cold and sarcastic, but somehow he becomes impressed by the girl's strong character, ability for irony, and her unwillingness to be defeated. As time goes by, the other mystery of the house starts to intrigue Jane: in the third floor there's a locked room, from where sometimes come, muffled, a hysterical laughter and incoherent and incomprehensible words. Jane is led to believe it's one of the servants, an efficient but ""strange"" person. Subsequent episodes not worth revealing in a review slowly happen, and believe me they are terrifying, Gothic and violent. Little by little Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester, but it takes time for it to dawn upon her, and at some point, when she realizes, she realizes too taht she has no chance. He's rich, she's a poor thing without a name, heritage or fortune. She thinks he's going to marry a beautiful and arrogant woman from the neighborhood. One day, the horrible aunt gets terminally sick, and Jane is sent for. She shows remarkable ability for forgiveness and stands by her aunt's side until the witch finally dies. When she comes back to Mr. Rochester's house, she will find her Fate, which I won't spoil for you.This rare novel is a jewel. First, because of the perfect construction of the character, indeed a person. Even though unbelievable coincidences happen sometimes in the novel, Jane is created so well that she is totally fleshed out before us. She is rather plain and short, a tiny, seemingly insignificant woman. But in truth she happens to be charming, funny, a little shy but courageous to the point of recklesness. She has a penetrating and acid sense of humor. Jane's life is an example of braveness, of the truly free individual creating his or her own destiny. Sometimes you just want to take her in your arms and comfort her, only to receive a bitter comment. At the time the novel was published, it raised eyebrows for the uncondescending presentation of an independent woman, always figthing for her rights and conscious of her being a free spirit, slave to no one. Jane is easily on of the best created character is all literature. For people like us, usually living in big noisy cities, experiencing life in the moors is a refreshing, even if sometimes terrifying, thing.Finally, ""Jane Eyre"", like ""Wuthering Heights"", is totally original literature. It comes from the fantasies and dreams of a woman who, like her sisters, lived practically isolated from the outer world, from the inelligentsia and from any literary or political circles. The Brontes were girls from the wild, and lived tragic and Gothic lives which get greatly reflectd in their books. Excellent.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I've read it countless times,"And each time I still find something new to love. On about the fifth or sixth reading, you finally start reading all those long descriptions word for word rather than breezing through for plot. They're wonderful and frequently humerous. Bronte has a tremendous sense of humor.My favorite things about the work are its humor and how it attacks fundamentalist Protestant Christianity while embracing Christianity. Unfortunately it has little tolerance for Catholicism. But that is only a minor theme and I think Charlotte Bronte herself was much more liberal minded when she was dealing with particular individuals rather than stereotypes. At the very least it is a lesson in the prejudices of her day.Jane Eyre is ultimately a fairy tale. Everything is made right in the end. But it has far more edge than a mere romance. How many romances have ten year olds telling off the fundamentalist ministers who threaten them with hell? How many of them have the eight year old outlive her anger and grow into a generous and forgiving spirit. How many mere romances rely so heavily on playful intellectual banter? Jane Eyre is Cinderella and she is rescued not by beauty and a fairy godmother and pumpkin coach, but by wit and heart.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my favorite books of all time,"This book was a complete surprise to me. I started the book not knowing anything about it, and finished with a new favorite book. The story is captivating, the characters are distinct and well realized, and I simply could not put it down!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Not What I Expected - A Bit Dull And Wordy,"A young girl is orphaned as a baby and is entrusted to her uncle and his family. When her uncle dies, it falls to her aunt to provide her care. Unfortunately, her aunt despises the young girl and eventually finds a way to send the young girl away. The young girl, Jane Eyre, enters a boarding school for girls of less significant means and it is there she can truly begin to take charge of her life and where her adventures, so to speak, begin.Jane Eyre did catch me up immediately and keep me involved through the first half of the book. It moved fairly quickly. However, I thought the story dragged a bit about halfway and throughout the second half. Personally, I found the book suffered from what most Romance era and Gothic writers had an affinity for: why use 5 words when 15 or 20 will do. The novel became wordy and overlong at times and I found myself putting it down for long periods of time. Quite frankly, I think the story is better told in the myriad of movies that have been released. I am quite at a loss as to exactly why this novel is such the classic it is.The character of Jane Eyre bothered me as well, but I think she was more truthfully written and my dislike reflects the wordy nature of the book. Jane is morally strong - and that is to be admired - but she is so emotionally cold - I never imagined her being ""in love,"" passionate or otherwise. Even though she states she is in love, there seems to be no passion or fire. What an oddly matched pair! Though, I get the same feelings when I read Jane Austen, so perhaps readers of Ms. Austen's novels will appreciate this one.This novel is not all terrible, despite what I've said. It is engaging, though I think parts can be skimmed. Those who absolutely adore Gothic romance will love it. Those of us who find Gothic romance dull and dreary will find this novel less than enchanting.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"This book is a wonderful book, but it drags quite a lot. Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of 19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first 150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull. The plot builds up like a snail crawling on grass but then at the top it falls like a roller-coaster. I do praise Charlotte for this work of art. It is as sweet as can be though I am not for romances.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I love this book! Definitely a keeper.,"This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Perfect for older males - a classic for the ages,"This book is a two-fer. I love Dickens and was thrilled to be steeped in the richness of the time period. If you believe in romantic love, this is the most moving book I've ever read. It's true lessons about life and love of all kinds make it a timeless classic among classics.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A most incredible acheivement!,"I had often heard of this book, but wondered why it was so popular. Now I know. I have read this book many times. The story is tantalizing and wonderful. It truly is a classic. You will not regret reading this book. The character Jane has something in her that all women can relate to. And the mystery of Thornfield and of Mr. Rochester will keep you turning each of the pages until you are completely immersed in the story. A must read for all generations.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyer,This is a book to read again and again I read it in grade 7 and loved it. In the begining Jane Eyer is a little girl. The book is about her growing up and falling in love with Mr. Rochester. Think everything is happy ever after...?? Think again.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre Great Teen Reading,Jane Eyre is a novel that captures the reader. It is about a young girl who experiences the hardships of everyday life. Living as an orphan she is driven to become successful and fall in love. She becomes a young writer nd often expresses her feelings and thoughts through her writing. As a young teenager I can easily relate to a lot of how she feels. I felt comfort in reading this novel because I am not the only person going through a lot of changes in my life. I recommend this novel to a lot of young readers and especially young teenage girls. Jane Eyre contains a point of view that captivates the reading.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane,"I don't remember when I first read Jane Eyre. I have read it on and off for years now, along with hundreds of other books. When I was younger, I admired everything Jane did; every decision she made was the right one. Jane was the heroine of the story and I didn't question her decisions. But.. after much reflection on the outcomes of her decisions, I have come to the conclusion that she was TOO strong, too determined that she must lead a faultless life. It was almost creepy, how iron willed she was. I think the true victim of the novel was not Jane herself, but the rich and powerful Fairfax Rochester, who was so much in love with her that even Jane hoped her leaving would not drive him to madness and despair.. His plea, ""You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer are all nothing to you?"" .. but Jane, in her determination to be true to her morals,walked away and left him in a near suicidal state. ""Oh, Jane, this is bitter. This is wicked."" These words fell from Mr Rochester's lips when he saw that she meant to leave. I tend to agree. It DID seem wicked to leave him on the verge of madness. He ask no more of her, at that time, than to just stay in residence until some alternative plan could be embarked upon. However, she didn't want to be suspetible to the worldy temptations embodied in Mr Rochester...She almost died because of her decision to tear herself away, and what happened to Mr. Rochester will make the reader shudder. But.. Jane's ""integrity"" and strength remain intact,and supposedly that is the lesson the reader is supposed to carry away. But I love Jane Eyre anyway,love the story, and have a leather bound edition of it on my bookshelf. It's beautifully written and deeply interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A heroine for the ages,"I read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, against my wishes, when I was a junior in high school and found it stuffy and dry, much like other books from the Victorian period. However, when I read it again as a sophomore in college my opinion change. I saw &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; as a heroine who fought her way from the bottom of society in order to make something out of herself.What I liked about the title character was that she was smart and even more importantly she was strong-willed. Somehow, Charlotte Bronte created a female heroine who had real character at a time when most women were used solely as ornaments and child-bearing machines.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A novel ahead of its time,"The protagonist is clear-headed, thoughtful, and independent. Even when she falls in love, she doesn't let that love take over her life. She knows that it's better to lose her love than to lose herself. That doesn't happen that often in &quot;love stories&quot; of the time.Even the &quot;happy ending&quot; of the story isn't completely happy -- it took a great deal of sacrifice and trouble for both Jane and her lover to get there.Most of today's &quot;Gothic&quot; novels are inferior copies at best of this book. Their heroines don't have half the brains or the personality of Jane.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Girl's Search for Love,"Jane Eyre was a very good book. At first glance, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this book because I didn't like the previoius Victorian book I read. This book proved to be a lot better. It was not a typical romance novel. Jane Eyre was a love story, but also had many unforeseen twists that kept my attention. I had no idea what was going to happen, and when something didn't go the way I had expected, I was worried about how it would turn out. I enjoyed the basic plot, but I liked the unpredictablility the most. This book took me a lot longer to read than I had expected. This was because Jane Eyre is at a high reading level. It had many vocabulary words that confused me. This was the only drawback to this book. I would recommend this book to ages 14-20 and to people that enjoy classical literature. It was very enjoyable, but I would not suggest reacing Jane Eyre to anyone who likes more action because this book describes each event in great detail. Overall, I thought this book was very enlightening and enjoyable.",positive

This novel for all its faults (journalistic style, over reliance on coincidence, a certain Byronic vulgarity to Rochester) simply transcends other English fiction of its time. Charlotte Bronte magics Jane Eyre into existence, the reader inhabits her consciousness. The book's first readers had never read anything like it: you can see why.

I read the first 2 chapters and could not get into it. But by the time I reached chapter 5 I couldn't put it down.It's one of those books you'll either love or hate.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,AWESOME!!!!!,"i have to say, being a female teenager, Jane Eyre is one of the best if not THE best book i have ever read. i could totally relate to Jane. She's not georgous, not excellent at any one thing, yet she gets her man. i found the characterization to be masterful, by the middle of the book you could tell what jane would do, yet the book wasn't as predictable as some other classic writers. (ahhem Charles ahhemmm Dickens ahheeemmm Ernest aaahheem Hemingway aaahhheeemmm)sorry, i just had to clear my throught there. this is definately a book for girls. i'm not sexist, but i find that if i can relate to a character in the book than i will find it entertaining. i would not reccomend this for any guys. but definately the best book i have ever read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"A beautiful story, beautifully written.","I read this book when a friend challenged me to deliberately read more books by women authors. This was one of the books I read, and I'm glad I did!I read that the Bronte's grew up writing stories for entertainment -- it seems to show. This story was moving and obviously written by someone with much experience. By the time I was half-way through the book, I was wrapped up in the story, and felt a commitment to the characters.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The best!,"I really love this book, I think I've read it three times now! I don't understand those who say that &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is boring, but I guess it depends on the individual taste. Anyway, you should really read this book, and it doesn't matter what I say here, just look at my 5 stars and let them (and the book) speak for themselves.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!,"If I could, I would give this book ten stars! I was so sad when I finished it, and I keep wishing that there was a sequel. I didn't think I'd like it in the begining, but when I got into it, I couldn't put it down! You've got to read it!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Everyone should read Jane Eyre. Don't blame me if you don't,"The first time I read Jane Eyre I was quite young and I hated it. Then in college I took a semester long course where we analyzed every little thing... I thought it woukd be even more boring but it was FASCINATING. This book can be read on so many different levels, there is so much symbolism and metaphor, that I discover something new each time.By the way, if you liked Jane Eyre, read Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys...",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A great book with a good message in following your heart.,"I loved jane eyre. I thought the book was well written, and a beautiful love story. Jane is a strong willed woman who stood up for what she wanted, and in the end got what she desired most.",positive

This book is definately one of my all time favorites!!! Read it NOW!!!!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A delicious read that cannot be rushed or lightly covered.,"A story from another time and place, rich in words, emotion, and narrative detail, fitting the romantic period of English history. Prepare yourself to go slowly at first to absorb the heroic character of Jane Eyre as she survives the not-to-be-gotten-around class system of 19th C England. By today's standards, she is not only fiercely independent and incredibly intelligent; she is morally superior. Suspense builds and delivers even if you have seen the movie. What a love story! Charlotte Bronte would have scored a perfect 800 on the Verbal SAT. Indeed, it probably would not have challenged her!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Buy This Book. Why?,"Because people who don't like this book are stupid poopheads. It's just that simple. Jane Eyre is a classic, not only of Victorian literature, but of all time. You must love it; and if you can't, there's something clearly wrong with you.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I really enjoyed the story,"This is the first time that I have been through this story. I'm sorry it took so long for me to get to it. Susan Ericksen narrates the audio book and the listening experience was something I looked forward to on my daily commute. The narrator had an excellent speaking voice and sounded just like what I would have expected from Jane Eyre. Her characterizations of the other characters were not as dramatic as I would have liked, though she did a good job with the `master'. I'm getting used to good characterizations since it makes it easier to follow who is speaking. Overall, I would rate the audio book at 4.5 stars instead of 5 due to the characterization issue.The story itself is wonderful. The main characters are very likeable despite their flaws. It's fun to see the main characters be rather homely instead of amazingly good looking as is common in many novels. It is a beautiful love story and shows strong integrity in Jane. In these days it is good to see this type of values in the heroines and heroes of the story.I highly recommend this audio book. It cannot disappoint.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Great Read,It's been nearly 27 years since I was forced to read a classic. This year I decided I wanted to read one. I couldn't have a made a better choice. As with many authors in her time she can go a little overboard with detail for my liking but this was a wonderful book and well worth every minute I spent reading it!,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Beautiful little book,"I bought this for a friend, and she and I both loved it. It is small but very pretty.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,great classic love story,I enjoyed this book. It is entertaining and at times very suspenseful. Just an all around good classic love story.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Great quality!,"I bought this book as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it! I also bought her Wurhering Heights from this same series. The detail on the cover is beautiful and really well-made. They include a little ribbon bookmark that is a fantastic touch and really helps give these books an old-timey feeling! All-in-all, if you're a fan of any of the books in this series, I would highly recommend them for you or a loved one as they do make great gifts.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,best of the bunch,"The notes and supplemental materials in this edition are truly helpful. I looked at several editions of JE, and found this the most useful. Typeface easy on the eye, and the paperstock makes for a pleasantly light tome. Found this superior to the Norton edition.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Mislabeled,"It was labeled as UNABRIDGED on the website when I ordered the audiobook. I got a refund, and the seller (the_book_depository_, who was very responsive) let me keep the copy. I didn't open the package since I'm going to give it to the town library.Soon afterwards, I bought an unabridged one: Jane Eyre (The Classic Collection) by Charlotte Bronte and Susan Ericksen (MP3 CD - May 25, 2005) - Audiobook, ISBN-10: 1596009411, 20+ hours. I enjoy this version very much.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Awesome during the commute!,"I was thrilled to find this on audiobook after being assigned the novel in my literary theory book. I am always short on time, with novels assigned for other classes, so this was the perfect way to capitalize on my 30 minute commute to school. The Penguin Classic differs slightly from the Norton Edition (which was assigned), so I found myself looking in the text for further detail, but it is the same story. The Norton simply gives footnotes to explain certain things, such as translating some of the French phrases. Great if you have a commute and need to read this, or just want to. Jane Eyre is a classic, beautifully written and narrated well in this audiobook.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A timeless Classic,"Jane Eyre is a Classic of epic proportions, it is a story which is timeless. From her early home life at Gateshead to her schooling at Lowood School then her stint as the Governess at Thornfield Manor the author breaks your heart, makes you feel such compassion and leads you down a journey of life's trials and tribulation.Her want of love and acceptance is a theme that plays out throughout the book.It is a timeless story with themes that center around Morals, Religion, Social Class and relationships between men and women.Charlotte Bronte gives us a beautiful story.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,a great read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I expected it to be slow, but I was actually able to finish it within a few days. I would definitely reccommend it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Truth and Lies,"Penniless. Defenseless. Powerless. This is the reality of Jane Eyre, a young orphan girl forced to cope with the callous world around her as a child. After the death of her parents, Jane is forced to reside with her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who despises her, and consequently sends Jane away to Lowood, a boarding school with little resources and poor housing conditions. Despite malnutrition and a harsh atmosphere, Jane strives to make her mark at the school, eventually becoming a teacher. Before she realizes it, Jane tries to escape from her old life and embarks on a new journey as a governess under the employment of a secretive and guarded gentleman. As Jane falls in love with her mysterious employer, she struggles to safeguard the little confidentiality she has left to protect herself from the secrecy and ill-will of others. Although Jane cautiously guards her heart instead of exposing her soul, a revelation of truth eventually catches up to her, causing more harm than the wrath of the deepest secrets. Jane finds herself trapped between truth and lies as she faces her past, her situation, and herself in a world where all odds are against her. Jane Eyre has remained a classic in literature because Bront illustrates the necessity of secrets in life, therefore supporting the tendency of human nature to occasionally slip in a guilt-free secret or two into one's life.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Quite a good novel,"From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones. Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story. Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story. It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane. By the end I felt I knew her.The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault. There are many places in the book that could have been shortened. I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.It is a lovely story. I recommend it if you hunger for a love story. It is lengthy, so some patience is needed at times, but it is well worth it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Who knew?,"This is an absolutely awesome book. I didn't really think I would like it all that much when I started it, but it turned out to be one of my all-time favorite books. I recommend it highly.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre - Timeless and Enjoyable,"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre was truly an enjoyable novel for me to read. Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Bront's novel, grows up as an orphan child in oppressive surroundings; however, she overcomes the repression of her cruel childhood and follows her heart to find out who she is and where she truly belongs. Readers, especially female readers, can easily identify with Jane because they are all searching for themselves or have already done so at some point in their lives. Although there are a few parts of the novel which are difficult to read, the novel is essentially easy to read and understand, mainly because it is actually written to and for the reader. Readers are still able to make a connection with Jane's passionate feelings, her love of religion, and her struggle with difficult decisions, because the readers of today must still deal with those same situations that Jane dealt with over one hundred and fifty years ago. Readers can learn from the balance Jane maintains between her conscience and her intuition as influences to the difficult decisions she makes. Jane's undying sense of hope is inspiring and shows readers that hope and faith are the only things needed to carry on in life.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Quest for Freedom,"Jane Eyre has an odd place in literary history. It is one of the most compelling reads ever written, and in my opinion, it uncovers so much about the nature of being a human. The novel's a page-turner for its entertainment value as well as for its ability to enlighten.Jane is a poor orphan born in a society that fights her ability to attain financial, emotional, sexual, and spiritual freedom. From the beginning of the novel, Jane is on a quest to gain her liberation. Of course, she cannot do so by herself. She must retain enough fortitude to be her true self, and she must be an instrument of grace, of change, in the life of Rochester.Everything in the novel conspires toward the creation of a near-perfect novel. I cannot believe I waited so long to experience this masterpiece, but I will certainly be returning to it over and over through the rest of my life. This novel cannot be missed by anyone who wants to read truly great literature or by anyone who just wants to experience a great read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,a timeless tale that will be around forever.,"I first read Jane Eyre when I was thirteen, and I fell in love with it almost instantly as soon as I finished the first chapter. As you follow Jane's hardships from her troubled childhood through to her near-doomed relationship with the dark, brooding, and deathly handsome Rochester, you feel as if those hardships were your own. After all, aren't we all plain Jane Eyre's at times?",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Classic Love Story,It took me a while to get into this novel. I like it the characters are interesting and very dark. It starts off really slow but picks up eventually. I like how it ended and the words are nice to read.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,So good I cried,"This is an excellent book, and such a good read. Don't be intimidated by the length, because you will certainly get so enraptured, and taken in, that you wont even notice it. I must say that Jane Eyre is one of the most endearing and enjoyable characters that i've encountered. Charlotte Bronte develops her perfectly. I love her ability to poke fun at and tease her admired one, Mr Rochester; it's refreshing, and my idea of love. It develops at a nice, steady pace, never lagging. The tone and the references to the reader suit the book quite well, and I believe that the story was far ahead of its time. Why four out of five? Well, i found certain parts of the story far too unbelievable, and Mr. Rochester seemed to go from stern and haughty, to love-sick and passionate all too quickly, that I found it somewhat ingenuine. I believe that the end is what really made the story worthwhile, when Jane goes back to see her beloved once more. That is when i started to tear. Overall it was well written, and deserves all the credit given to it.a pleasure to read =)",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Wow, an awesome book with an unusual story-line","I am a 15 year old sophmore who was required to re-read this book for an honors class. Reading it the second time not only helped me to understand it more, but to like even more. Jane Eyre is a wonderful book that comes from out of the blue. To me when I first heard I had to read it as a freshman, it was just another one of those classics that they made you read. However, as the stroy progressed I really enjoyed learning about how Jane delt with everything. Not only did I begin to dislike the people that Jane disliked, but I began to start looking at everyday situation and wonder how she might handle them. Overall, it was a wonderfully written book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A great book that can be somewhat hard to read.,"I am a 15 year old freshman who was required to read this book for an honors class. At first I was annoyed at the lengh and appearence of &quot;another boring classic&quot; that I would hate. Once I started to read Jane Eyre I was immediatly drawn in. The descriptions of seens, though long and tedious, were magnificent. The story line itself realy touched me. I found myself dislikeing all the characters that Jane disliked and having a grudge against all the characters who were unjust to Jane. I found jane to be a kind of idol. Her courage to speak up for herself and never let anyone walk all over her was really encouraging to me. By the end of the book I was in love with Mr. Rochester and felt my own ties with Thornfeild, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, and all the others. I encourage people to read this book! What I thought was going to be a boring assignment turned into a pleasure. Me, a person who really dislikes reading, found myself reading every night. I hope kids and adults alike read this book and enjoy it. It was somewhat of a challenge for me, but it was well worth it!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Jane Eyer, An All Time Classic","Charolette Bronte never seces to amaze me. she seems to bring her characters to life, as they jump off the page and into you head. After reading Jane Eyer, you will find yourself constantly wondering how she is doing. This book will follow you wherever you go, and unconcesly haunt you mind. It is an ultimate classic that everyone must read! What makes this book so great? Charolette Brontes wonderful skill, of making the characters so real, is what makes this book a classic. She describes Jane in such a way, that everyone can find a bit of themselves in her, and often can relate to her thoughts, and her feelings. Her inocence, just seems to surround her. She has such a pure love, a pure want, and yet she is so inocent, that we long to be like her. Her inteligence and pride, add to her, and make her a prominent figure in our minds. With out Charolette Bronte's wonderful depiction of Jane, this book would not be near as powerful as it is now. The romance in this novel, makes you wan to reach out and hug Jane. You wan tto tell her that everything will be all right, and with the hard life that she had suffered through, when she finds love, you want to cry for her. As the Climax of the book arrives, you find yourself reading, with a tear sliding slowly down you cheek. You feel you eyes fill up as you want to weep with her. YOu want her to know you are there. with out the romance, that touches your heart, this book could not be the same, and would not touch the heart in the same way. The simplicity of theh plot, helps to make the book a hit. If this book were not simple and plain, it would become a bore, but it is nothing more than a young girls life, as she grows, her terrible treatment from her aunt, her schooling, and her first love. This book is so simple that it is almost amazing.Clearly this book is wondeful. You will find your self reading it over and over again! I suggest it to all of those who enjoy a good romance, with lots of love and hope!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Still beautiful after all these years,"Numerous movies have been made of this novel, or based in parts on the novel, and there is a reason why: it is a haunting, coming-of-age story, with a dark mystery and love story embedded within. Jane Eyre, who is shunted around due to her &#34;unladylike&#34; intelligence and strong sense of self, discovers love with her employer-the strange and moody Mr. Rochester. He is hiding a secret though, and it will threaten Jane's chance of happiness. Unlike many &#34;love&#34; stories from past and present however, Jane uses her inner-strength to succeed on her own, and sets the example for future &#34;strong women&#34; stories that have developed since this groundbreaking novel was written.The wordy descriptions and redundancy of some of the writing clearly dates this novel as a &#34;classic&#34; but do not let that scare you from reading. Having read this more than once, I like to skim much of it, including descriptions of her early years at the school Jane is sent to, for standing up for herself at the home she were she grew up. The descriptions DO set the mood for everything, but are still overly-wordy, which was the norm for this period of writing. One exception to this, is the novel &#34;Ivanhoe,&#34; set during the time of Robin Hood and written during the time of Queen Victoria's birth. Otherwise, as with the Bronte's works, you will deal with a lot of seemingly-useless descriptive paragraphs. AGain, it does set the mood though, and the writing itself is beautiful, even if it doesn't always forward the purpose of the story.This story is haunting, much like &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; but I prefer &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; any day for the sheer strength of the heroine, and the surprisingly moving passion of the star-crossed lovers.",positive

However, it was still a pleasure to read. Jane is a admirable heroine and I loved everything about her. I truly cared about what happened to her which I haven't been able to do with books I've read. Rochester's and Jane's love was deep and pure and I loved watching them go through the process of falling in love. It wasn't an OMG-I-don't-know-anything-about-you-but-I-love-you-like-crazy thing that I've been reading lately. It was slow but sure and so very sweet. Their difference in age was strange to me at first, but as time went on I found myself not caring. Love really knows no bounds.I love this book. It is definitely near the top of my favorite books. The story, dialogue, and cast of characters all went together. Every character in this story has depth. They're not stale, cardboard cut-outs.Anyway, I definitely recommend this book. It's one of my favorites.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,unforgettable classic,"Jane Eyre is Charlotte Bronte's first novel, published under the pen name of Currer Bell. Jane Eyre, orphaned at a very young age, suffers at the hands of her aunt and cousins when her maternal uncle dies. At the age of ten, she is sent to a charity boarding school, where her life is also filled with privation until an outbreak of typhus exposes the austere measures imposed by the manager of the school. At the age of eighteen, she leaves the school to become a governess to Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester's ward, Ad&egrave;le. Here, Jane seems to find happiness: beneath Mr Rochester's moody exterior, there appears to be kindness and perhaps even love? But further events may destroy her chance at happiness.The use of words that seem to be nowadays obsolete, such as: unclose (doors etc); undraw (curtains); undeceive; benignant; show how much can change in a language in a mere 200 years. Described as a classic, it is easy to see why Jane Eyre is one of the most unforgettable of English novels.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"One of the two most passionate, intense females of all literature - an amazing read","It's incredible to think or imagine that, of the two most intense, passionate heroines of 19th century literature, both would be written by sisters of the same family. But this is, indeed, the case. With Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, you are drawn into a personal narrative that from the start is compelling and becomes more disturbing and troubling. Many things have been written about Jane Eyre as a character, but to me there is no doubt that her intense character compels you to understand very specific and certain imperatives (nowadays described as feminist - then, Bronte was alone in imaginging it).The 19th century was a deeply moralistic society, at least on the surface, but one within and beneath which women as such had no identity or power beyond certain circumscribed roles (governess, wife, spinster, etc.). With Jane, you have a particular set of codes of behaviour that are radically established and are uncompromising about the male-dominated status quo: to cope with all circumstances without significant protest; not to give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; to speak up in situations involving the most appalling difficulties, when it matters; don't give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; ultimately, remain true to yourself. Such coda are radical not only in 19th century literature, but all literature before.Jane Eyre is a revolution in thinking and morality as far as male and female relationships are concerned. The only other novel that is as passionate, and as determined in thinking of the singular female self as Jane Eyre, is Emily Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights, and her character, Catherine Earnshaw; yet Jane Eyre remains, through her novel, uncompromised of her own integrity and character, despite her circumstances et al. Catherine, according to Emily's narrative, is never given such a choice, or options of such freedom, i.e. independent female thinking.Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is an astonishing novel: besides Wuthering Heights, by her sister Emily, it is one of the most passionate, intense, uncompromising, painful, and beautifully and intensely emotionally sustained novels of all literature. An astonishing achievement, irrespective of genre, author or century.",positive

The dialogue that she would exhibit was far beyond her years, especially when she would go back and forth with Rochester. I was fascinated by just about everything Jane Eyre went through.It takes me a while to read books but it didn't take long for me to read ""Jane Eyre"" by Charlotte Bronte. My daughter read it in grammar school and she enjoyed it, but I think I enjoyed it better because of the period it was set in and the way the story evolved.Whether you are in high school or an adult, if you like classic stories, I don't think you can go wrong with this classic romance novel.Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6"" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Brit Lit classic,"Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" was never one of my favorite British novels. However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, ""Jane Eyre"" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. ""Jane Eyre"" doesn't come close to ""Wuthering Heights,"" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My first Bronte... not my last!,"This was the first book I read by Charlotte Bronte, and after I finished it I immediately got Villette, then The Professor, and Shirley, and others! She quickly became my favorite author, mainly due to the spirit I felt coming through her writing. She seems to be a true Christian, free from a religious mind-set, and with hopeful views of humanity. I think she is very intelligent, and a little ahead of her time. I love her language and the flow of her writing. The book is romantic but a bit dark, which was a bit refreshing actually. (Although nowhere near as dark as her sister's Wuthering Heights). Read it, it is great, and don't stop at just this book. Shirley is by far my favorite.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Excellent, accessible writing","Contrary to popular fiction of her day, Bront is keen to keep reminding us that Jane Eyre is no beauty, irregular in feature, and plain. That Rochester is dark, brooding, and not handsome, with a deficient moral history.Can such imperfects unite? Can earthy limits find heaven in love and devotion? Often he calls her by her own name. Other times he calls her by another name, an invention of endearment. What does he call her? From calling him Sir she moves to a name born of equality and devotion. What does she say? New naming is not so strange, as in Revelation 3:12: ""I will write upon him my new name.""Can we ordinary persons unite? Can we couples live with each other's limitations, and be happy and joyful? We do it all the time. How many of us are perfect?Are the marriages of the ""beautiful people,"" the celebrities, superior to those of the rest of us?

I'm 13, so perhaps I'm too young to grasp it, but I enjoyed other books which are supposed to be similar, such as Pride and Prejudice.In the 13-year-old vernacular, here's what was going through my mind:Ew! Why the heck would she marry that weird, bad-tempered, hairy scary man? If I found out that my fiance had kept his insane first wife in the attic and not told me, I'd file for divorce! He's bossy, unreasonable and mean. Why'd he pretend to wanna marry Miss Ingram?

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte,"JANE EYRE by Charlotte BronteJane Eyre, a rather dry book that somehow captures the heart of the English Literature fans, but makes the young male want to sleep. The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My opinion on Pride and Prejudice,"Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,Like being audited by the IRS,"You've probably heard the expression that a million monkeys typing for a million years eventually will reproduce the works of William Shakespeare. I give ""Jane Eyre"" one monkey, ten minutes.While recognizing Bronte's derring-do in writing a novel about a homely 17-year-old governess who rejects a virtuous adonis (St. John Rivers) for her much older and unattractive employer, this is a book I cannot see reading again unless it's the only way to save a terminally ill relative.This book is a slow read. And I mean slow. A snail? Greased lightning. Molasses on a cold day? Quicksilver. Eighth-period study hall in high school on a Friday? Over in a flash. We're talking a slow, boring read here, even without the benefit of a high school English teacher's enthusiasm for ruining literature.The novel chronicles the story of Jane Eyre from her childhood as an orphan up until the birth of her first child. Life was hard for orphans in 19th-century England, particularly when their parents' marriage was considered improper. Fair enough, I suppose: that's why Jane's childhood is so rotten, and she is picked on by the cousins she lives with, misliked and mistreated by her aunt and so on. Unfortunately, Bronte's writing is so dry and lifeless that it's hard to care.It just gets worse from there. The book is written in the first person, with the result that we get to hear every self-pitying thought Jane has (and there are plenty of them), about how plain she is, how her employer Mr. Rochester could never love her, how beautiful her imagined rival in love is, and on and on and on for page after tedious page.My standard joke is ""This is both good and original. Unfortunately, the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good."" I will give Charlotte Bronte the benefit of the doubt, and will say that ""Jane Eyre"" is thoroughly original. Unlike the works of Shakespeare and a number of other classics of English and world literature, I can't say it is particularly good.Jocko Grinn",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Just Okay,"The book Jane Eyre was only okay. In the beginning it was very hard to get in to. Nothing interesting really happened until later on in the book. It was also really boring in parts when she described things like the weather. She would go in to so much detail and drag it on forever. There would be pages of her describing one thing. In a way it can be good because you can really make a good picture in your head, but it can get really annoying and boring fast. As the book went on it did seem to pick up a little bit. There were very interesting things actually happening in the book. There were times where I did not want to set down the book. For instance, I liked how the main character, Jane, wasn't the rich, beautiful, popular girl. She was plain and simple. I liked this because it is different from most other books. It shows a life about a girl who, like most of us, does not get everything she wants. I really enjoyed that part of the story. I also enjoyed the part when she inherited a lot of money from her uncle. At the same time she learned about three new cousins of hers. Not even knowing them, she split her money. It showed how much she cared about family more than money. That was a good lesson in the book. In another part of the book there is something that goes along with that and that is when Mr. Rochester tells Jane about Adele and her mother. He took care of Adele even though he did not believe that she was even his. That showed some responsibility in Mr. Rochester. However there were a lot of things that happened in the book that I did not like. I did not like Mr. Rochester. He was a selfish liar. It seemed like he was always keeping a different secret and lying about it. He lied to Jane many times but yet they still get married. I thought that was ridiculous. At first I thought Jane was stronger than that, but this really showed how weak she was. She went back to him although he kept lying to her. I mean he had a wife who needed help locked up on the third floor. That seemed a little too crazy to fall in love with a guy who does that. I felt like she got married because she did not want to be so lonely and she did not really care what kind of person it was she did marry. Although, she did know that she did not want to marry Mr. St. John which was a good thing because I do not think that he wanted to marry her for the right reasons. After Jane told him that she did not want to marry him, he went right back to his religion and it did not really bother him. Overall, the book was not the best or anything. It had a couple parts I enjoyed. On the other hand, there were many parts that either bored me or annoyed me.",negative

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,Age does not a classic make- truly a boring book.,"I truly cannot understand why anyone would be awed by Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A very worth-while novel,"I was a little apprehensive to read this book at first because it was written in the 19th century, and I speculated that it would not be an easy read. I figured that I would give it a try though, and I am glad that I did. Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read.It is a love story, but not in the typical sense of traditional romances. It incorporates an actual plot line as to how two characters fall in love over a long period of time and follows through the depths of despair and joy. The twisting of conflicts and happiness throughout the story leave the reader laughing and crying, and never being able to predict an outcome.Jane Eyre has a well-developed plot that includes rounded characters whom the reader comes to identify with. Bronte's heroine, Jane, (who also narrates the book) is a believable character because she is not exceedingly intellectual, she is not beautiful, she is not wealthy, yet she is autonomous and strong-willed, unlike Jane Austen's heroines (i.e. Emma Woodhouse), who are invariably the opposite. Although Jane is simple and modest, her life is full of constant suffering. She is easy to like because of these characteristics, just as some of the other characters are easy not to like because of their own unique characteristics.Bronte highlights certain aspects in this novel that people of the 19th century went through and experienced through the depiction of Jane's own life: being poverty-stricken, being orphaned, being unwanted, being plain, or being driven insane with the unattainable. This book not only gives the reader a deeper sense of the past, but also allows him to empathize for people that lived in it, and therefore to empathize with Jane.Each time I read Jane Eyre I cry over and over again. It is a fantastic piece of work that should be read by everyone. Truly a masterpiece!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,WONDERFUL!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I have read it twice, and I LOVE IT!!! I admit it is slow in the beginning, but it quickly speeds up and you can't put it down! Charlotte Bronte is my FAVORITE author!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Amazing,"I think I've read Jane Eyre three or four times, and the more I look at it the more I appreciate how amazing it is. Often I can't be bothered to start a new book, and I can just pick J E up and read it from any point.I don't understand how Charlotte Bronte could have written so much and had power in almost every sentence. Classics are hard to get into, and maybe the first chapter was slow but at the same time ghostly.I picked out few faults and though I'm an inexperienced school girl I haven't read many more books which were so intense, an yet somehow managed to keep the reader on tenterhooks.How real life her writing is, but at the same time supernatural. For me, Jane Eyre is a living person and she always will be.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Best Book I Ever Read!!!,"In short, Jane Eyre is the story of a fairly unconventional life. Jane is orpahned when she is young and sent to live with her Aunt Reed, to a horrible &quot;school&quot;, then to work as a governess at Edward Rochester's home. She falls in love with Mr. Rochester but his secrets may make it imposible for them to ever be together.The book has a really slow, melodic feel to it, so if you like fast reads, it is not the book you're looking for.This is one of the best books I have ever read, so good its one of few that I have actually read several times over. Definately a classic.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Don't watch the movie and expect to know a thing about Jane!,"This is an absolutely wonderful and captivating book. Once you start it you just gotta finish it!The best part of Jane Eyre (pronounced ""air"") is the love story between Jane and Edward, her employer. Edward keeps a dark secret , the nature of which isn't telegraphed but instead thrust upon the reader all at once (very well done!!!), that makes him both penurious and tragic. This makes him a somewhat odd match for Jane who is the epitome of virtue and is self denying. The cat and mouse play in the begining of their relationship, the way they individually struggle after the secret is revealed, and the ultimate resolution of their love story makes this one of the greatest novels in Engish literature.This brings me to the movie. It isn't a very good adaptation of the book. Major parts of the plot are missing or altered beyond recognition and signifigance. I watched the movie AFTER I read the book and was glad I did it in that order. Their are some stories that just have to be read in order for you to enjoy them;Jane Eyre is one of them (David Copperfield is another). But that's o.k., Charlotte Bronte has provided us with a tale that mesmerizes and impacts its reader like few others can. If it comes down to the movie or the book...read the book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I just adored this book!,"I recently finished Jane Erye and I couldn't bear the thought of there not being more of it to read. At first I thought it was strange that Jane could fall in love with such a cold, hard man. But then it turned out that he had a certain charm and gentleness that was buried deep inside him, not to show its face until Jane uncovered it. I think a big reason that some people don't like this book is because they expect Jane to fall in love with a handsome, obviously charming man. But that kind of romance is done too often in literary works, and eventually it loses its effect. In his own suttle way, Mr. Rochester is Prince Charming, though it takes time and patience to see. The book has a slow start, but stick with it. I've seen two movie versions of this story already, and it's a shame to put the title Jane Eyre on them. They are great stories in themselves, of course, but they hardly do the book justice. I'm 14 years old now, and in a few years I plan to read this book again, in hopes of getting more out of it than I already have.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Romance and Mystery Collide!,"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a thrilling romance novel. Set in England in the 1800s, this novel tells of the life of Jane Eyre. Jane is an orphan left in the care of her aunt, Mrs. Reed. At Gateshead, the Reed's estate, she lives a life of solitude and hate, mistreated and misunderstood by all. At the age of ten, she is sent to grim Lowood school, a reformatory school for orphans. Her years at Lowood are gloomy and dull, and she has few friends. When she is 18, she advertises as a governess, and finds a job at Thornfield Hall. Thornfield is all she ever wanted; there she is happy and loved, until a twist of fate and a long kept secret find her once more in peril. This novel is very romantic and heart warming. Charlotte Bronte has a knack for making her characters and situations seem real. At times I felt as though I were right there with Jane, sharing her hopes and dreams. I found this book to be interesting and fun to read, although at times it became drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels with wonderful characters, settings, and situations.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,I had expected a bit more...,"I am a 14-year-old girl and a novice towards 19th century British lit. I've never read an Austen and I cannot compair this book to Wuthering Heights (as I have never read that one either). I can only offer my less than expert opinion.This book was very enjoyable, at times. Until Mr. Rochester shows up, however, the book is very slow. The heroine grows on you quickly, so it makes the reading more fun. Jane is likeable, and I certainly cared more and more about her as the book progressed. I liked how blunt she could be at times and how stubborn. She displayed a great deal of strengh and determination, in a tough world, without the gifts of beauty and fortune. Jane has to make it on her own steam, and I think that a lot of modern girls could learn from her example.The story line with Mr. Rochester's crazy wife is a bit random, but very interesting none-the-less, and it added a layer of mystery to the plot.The ending of this book irked me the most, however, because (without giving it away) everything sort of falls into place. This bugged me because, up until then, Jane had to overcome issues and, in the end, her happiness was more or less handed to her.My one other complaint is that dear Jane Eyre likes to ramble about God and life and whatever else she sees fit to ramble about. It is dull dull dull, as the young girl muses on and on in her own head and we have to sit through it.I still very much liked the book though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting little romance with an awesome heroine.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"a Victorian genius in any language, but not for everyone","The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, ""Whoa--where did THAT come from?"" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, ""It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!"" just as the answer to modern western readers is, ""It's wrong but fun--just do it!""This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (""Ghostly happenings"" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,This is a classic!,"If I read it in high school, I don't remember it. I do remember reading Wuthering Heights ~~ but that was in college. Jane Eyre is much more romantic than Wuthering Heights ~~ it is a Cinderella Tale with a happy ending too!Jane was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by a cold-hearted aunt and terrible cousins before being shipped off to an institution. Jane makes the best of her lowly lot in life and decided to take a chance of living life to the fullest by taking a governess job for Mr. Rochester. Little does she know how much life would change because of that decision!The trials and tribulations that beset Jane are those that every woman can identify with. The joy and fear of falling in love with Mr. Rochester (Edward) is inspiring. The tragic secret that Edward failed to disclose to Jane ~~ sending her away is so sad. Jane finds herself again in a town many miles away from her beloved ~~ and finds her family after all these years. Only the unrequited love for Edward was the mar on the beautiful paradise she has found. She does find love again and grows into this splendid woman who is strong and independent ~~ and yet, still very feminine.I strongly believe that everyone should read this classic as Charlotte Bronte wrote a thought-provoking novel filled with description and conversations. It is a moral book ~~ designed to make the reader think of what is right and what is wrong. Jane stood up for her belief at the cost of her love ~~ though it was one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. And love finds her again.This is a book that makes you believe that if you have faith, things will come right and true for you. Even if it wasn't already a classic, it should be.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Still one of the all-time greats,"Jane Eyre deserves its place among the all-time greats, as my recent re-read of it showed. The numerous movie versions of it, including the most recent, never do Bronte's prose justice. I believe all modern romance novels sprang from the Bronte sisters' great works, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Jane Eyre is the more tightly wound of the two. Charlotte spins Jane's interior monologue and her emotional dialog with Rochester into a taut emotional web at the core of Jane, who is a complex and powerful lead character. Rochester is painted as an aloof, arrogant elitist, who is then humanized as Jane's gentler character opens him up.The story itself is masterfully plotted with the same craft and care as the characterizations. Charlotte wastes nothing and no seed planted in Jane's lonely and loveless life early in the novel goes without bearing fruit later in her tale.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Resurgam,"Whew...I finally finished! I have been holding on to this book since April 2011. It's not because the book was loathsome but because I began to feel as if Jane and I had become friends. As crazy as that may sound, I really hated for this book to end because it felt as if I was parting ways with an old friend.We are introduced to Jane Eyre as a young orphan residing with her uncle's (deceased) wife, Mrs. Reed, and three cousins. Jane was not welcome in their home and was sent to Lowood boarding school. The conditions at Lowood were horrible. Lowood was about survival and Jane soon found out that some didn't. Jane remained at Lowood until she was nineteen where she then transferred to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is at Thornfield Hall where Jane's strong resolve and concrete emotions are put to the ultimate test. Here is where the love story begins. Jane and her new employer Edward Rochester fall in love but not without challenges. Even though it was the perfect fairy tale ""rich man falls in love with lonely orphan,"" this is where the story takes a turn. Mr. Rochester has a secret. Just when you think nothing else bad can happen to Jane worse knocks the door down.Needless to say Jane had to flee Thornfield Hall abruptly without any direction or much else. She was stranded, starving, and sick when she ended up on the door step of a family that would nurse her back to health. The Rivers family took Jane in and she began to gain her strength mentally, emotionally, and physically. The family was made up of two sisters and a brother. Jane became instant friends with them all. The brother, St. John Rivers, actually discovered the destitute Jane who had been turned away initially by the family servant. During her season with the Rivers family, Jane received one of the best revelations of her life. Her ending up on the door step of the Rivers home was not a coincidence it was ""divine"" intervention. St. John Rivers had other plans for Jane once he had studied her for a while. St. John is very stoic and manipulating individual all under the guise of ""minister."" Jane does not fall for his manipulative tactics and follows her heart back to Thornfield Hall. When she arrives at Thornfield Hall she stumbles upon a shocking and horrifying surprise.Jane Eyre is just a ""boss"" type chick (if can describe her in hip-hop terms). She faced some insurmountable odds but all these back to back hardships birthed a certain unexplainable resilience in her. Jane was not easily broken because she was grounded in her faith. Bronte developed a character that we need to encourage all young women to read and get to know. Jane didn't succumb to fleshly temptations but instead she fled and this led to a great rewards. Jane's valley experiences let her to a mountaintop of blessings and real love.This book is a classic that has been reviewed numerous times. Most that read Jane's story count her as an old friend because they have been reading her story since high school. Prior to reading this book, I saw several references to it being ""gothic"" and there is even a goth illustrated edition. As I read, I began to think it should be categorized as ""Christian"" fiction. I absolutely fell in love with all the Biblical references and how grace and faith played major roles throughout the entire story. Jane Eyre started out an orphan who was pressed on every side by adversity but she grew to be a strong woman that one could liken to the mythical phoenix.",positive

When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Jane Eyre. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I went between applauding Jane's high morals and commitment to yelling at her for being such a doormat.As I was reading the story, I asked my husband, ""Was it really like this in Europe back then? Super rich people and super poor people and no in between?"" It makes for a good story of a girl thrown into a charitable facility/orphanage, going out on her own, falling in love, and staying true to her feelings. The ending was warm and fuzzy.The gist of the story is girl gets abused, sent to an orphanage, succeeds as a teacher and when she turns 18 ventures out to be a governess, falls in love, is gilted, ventures out again, finds relatives, and then . . . well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's a good read.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"It is Jane Eyre, sir","It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Powerful windswept novel of revelation and passion,"Although I found this novel a bit too windswept, making it hard to turn the pages in an orderly fashion, I was awe-struck by its darkly gothic mood, the barely suppressed passions of its characters, and the threat of violent transgression that seems to haunt every scene like a towering shih-tzu.My gym teacher used to warn me about books like this.

He leaned down and looked me straight in the eye. ""You know I'm worried, don't you. I'm worried about your manhood. I'm worried you're going to waste that great gift you've been given, that great dodge-ball arm, and just -- ""Oh forget it. I'll save the rest of this story for my therapist.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Love, loss, and redemption","Word has it that ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most imitated novels in literature, having almost singlehandedly spawned the genre of romantic fiction which supplies all those erotic-looking pulp paperbacks you see next to the magazine rack at the supermarket. What I found in Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, however, was a smart, resolute, and independent heroine who stands out like a beacon in a sea of Victorian fictional women. As if obeying some sort of literary convention, the book does have a sad beginning and a happy ending, but in between there are some very rich surprises: moments of mystery, tension, and ghostly images, delivered in a tightly paced narrative.Jane Eyre is an orphan who has spent the first ten years of her life with a mean aunt who mistreats her and the next eight years at a miserable school for indigent girls called Lowood. With this education, she qualifies herself as a teacher and secures a position as a governess at a house called Thornfield Hall. Her employer is a man twice her age named Edward Rochester, and her charge is his ward, a little girl of French parentage named Adele.Given that Jane soon falls in love with him, it might be guessed that Rochester is a dashing, noble, gallant gentleman; but no: He is unattractive, eccentric, shifty, assumes disguises, and rarely gives a straight answer to a question. These might merely be manifestations of a quirky, enigmatic personality, or maybe he is so evasive because he is hiding something from his past -- as indeed he is, and that ""something,"" incriminating and dangerous, is locked up in Thornfield Hall, unknown to Jane and most of the servants.Rochester falls in love with Jane, too, despite his apparent attention to a conceited society woman named Blanche Ingram. After a short courtship and a marriage proposal, however, Jane breaks off with him when she discovers his secret. Abandoning Thornfield Hall for a new life, she meets a young parson named St. John Rivers who is planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary. Thus, she has had to reject two men in her life: the first because he was not honest with her and made her feel used and deceived; the second because he is not looking for a wife, but a co-worker.Jane is not foolish, but she is human. That she returns to Rochester does not mean she has decided to accept his faults, but that she realizes they have developed that special kind of mutually dependent relationship that only two people who are truly in love may foster. By the end of the novel, Rochester loses a great deal because of his mistakes, and Jane's love is his only redemption; Jane, on the other hand, gains much because of the strength of her character, and Rochester's love is the fulfillment of her desire.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre: a real woman,"The book, Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is considered to be a work of genius, and with good reason. The story revolves around the life of an orphan, Jane Eyre, living in England in the 1900s. The book starts out during her childhood, when she lived with her cruel Aunt Reed and cousins Georgiana, John, and Eliza, and her years at the Lowood School as both a student and a teacher. Then, Jane takes a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall. When she lives there, she falls in love with her master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and they plan to marry. But Jane's happiness is destroyed when she learns of the horrible secret Mr. Rochester has keeping from her, and she leaves him. A few years pass, and Jane is now the head master at a small school, when she learns that she has cousins who are still alive, which is very important to her. She lives with her cousins for awhile, but eventually returns to the love of her life, Mr. Rochester, because she misses him. When she returns to him, she learns of the many bad things which have befallen him and Thornfield Hall, but in the end, she is very content with her life.This is an excellent book, especially because of the way the main character, Jane Eyre, is portrayed. She is not perfect, because she isn't very attractive, or very well liked. She is very shy and has many personality flaws, including ""a wicked heart, especially for such a young girl"" ( pg. 39). But she also has many good qualities about her; she is very kind and humble. The book provides just the right balance of good and bad to make Jane Eyre a very real and likeable character. Another reason why Jane Eyre is such a great book is because although it is very long, over 600 pages, the book moves very quickly, and there are almost no long portions of the book where nothing happens. Anytime there was a lull in the book, a major event would occur and the plot would move quicker, thus making the book seem shorter than it really was. Another reason why this book was so good was that it was a great picture of life for women in the 1900s. The book really showed that all that most women possessed was there title, and if they lost that, then they had nothing. However, Jane Eyre managed to rise above this, and in the end, the book's moral was about rising above your position in life, so that you could be truly happy.However, some people might disagree with my view on this book. Jane Eyre is at times a very sad book, and not everyone likes a sad book. Although Jane is generally happy, there is always a touch of sadness in her words and actions, which is why not everyone would agree with my review. However, there is plenty of good to out way the bad. This is a very interesting and compelling book which is very highly recommended. The plot is full of interesting people and places, it is written beautifully, and is a definite must read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"&quot;Poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;...and amazing","I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"A Realistic, Relatable Fairy Tale","A Realistic, Relatable Fairy Tale, by Michelle Giullain, student of Professor SWILUASome people never get sick of fairy tales. I, for one, have an incredible ability to hear the same story over and over again and never tire. Every once in a while, though, I crave something a little more realistic, while still maintaining that fairy tale `happily ever after' ending. It is hard to appeal to both sides of the spectrum, but Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre accomplishes this daunting task. Though it does have the typical fairy tale ending, it is a novel the audience can relate to. Instead of a fairy tale princess, Jane Eyre is the fairy tale story of a plain girl who faces real struggles. Bronte's realistic, relatable characters who face normal struggles allow the reader to relate to the novel, making it a book that will be thoroughly enjoyed for years to come.The characterization Bronte uses is truly genius, combining archetypal characters with human flaws. Oddly enough, it contains some of the fairy tale archetypes we are oh so familiar with, the evil stepmother and stepsisters. In this case, it is an abusive aunt and her spoiled children, but they fulfill the same role. Other archetypes, such as the sacrificial best friend, Helen Burns, and the crazy ex, Bertha, all show up in the novel. It speaks to the reader's emotions, because everyone has and archetypal figure in their life of some form. Whether or not you have an evil stepmother, or mother in law, it is comforting to read about other people who go through the same struggles as you, especially if your ex is still haunting you.Additionally, the characterization of the protagonist, Jane Eyre, gives the reader a direct connection to the novel. Her imperfections are what make her so perfect. Her outside appearance pales in comparison to the beautiful princesses, literally. Her pale skin and her plain face do not match the description of the usual princess. But, because Jane is not perfect, the audience can relate to her. Not many of us look just like a princess, have a castle, or a fairy godmother to grant our every wish. When we read about someone who isn't that beautiful, those who feel they are not as beautiful as Cinderella have someone to relate to. However, it is not only the outer appearance that makes Jane so ideal. She also has character flaws. She does not posses the patience to tame a beast, like Belle, or Snow White's affinity to the caretaking of small innocent creatures. Rather, her honesty and stubbornness, un-princess like qualities, show that she is human. She is not entirely confident in herself and feels loneliness. In her own words, ""I abhorred myself...I was hateful in my own eyes"" (329). Though we may not loathe ourselves all of the time, there are many instances in which a normal human in the normal world would not like themselves. This additional perspective into the imperfect Jane helps the reader connect to the book.Bronte also makes the other character's flaws apparent, especially in the man Jane comes to love. Prince not-so-charming, Rochester, has his own flaws inside and out. He, like Jane, is not beautiful, dashing, or handsome. He is rustic, unrefined, and unkind and that is not all. He tries to control Jane's actions and play with her mind. He has hidden baggage, too. His crazy wife, Bertha, is locked up in his attic. By the end, however, he has proven that he is a good person, just like Jane. He heroically tries to save his servants and crazy wife from his burning house, and loses an eye in the process. The key to the audience connection is the imperfection of not only Jane, but also Rochester. For, how possible would it be that Jane could find a dashing prince charming when she is not beautiful? And if Rochester were handsome, why would he pursue a relationship with a plain Jane? The two is absolutely perfect for each other. To the reader, it makes perfect sense that these two imperfect characters should get together. And, it might even remind them of their own romantic endeavors, or give them a little hope for the future.Beyond the imperfect characters, the relationship between the characters also contributes to the appeal to the audience by creating even more reality amid a fairy tale story. The Rochester-Jane romance is not a love at first sight experience, even though she does sweep him off his feet. (Actually, his horse slips on the ice the first time they cross paths, but that is not really the same thing). Though Prince Charming and Cinderella lacked a bit of communication, they never had any significant relationship problems. Snow white didn't even need to meet her Prince. One kiss and he made her feel alive. However, like most human relationships, Jane and Rochester fight, argue, feel jealously and hurt. They keep secrets and experience disappointments. Rochester invites a party of beautiful women to his house to make Jane jealous. Then, on the morning of their wedding, she finds out that he has a wife in the attic. Jane then runs away because she cannot bear the thought of being a mistress to Rochester. Rochester is devastated and almost gives up living because he has lost Jane. Though they love each other, their relationship is not always perfect. Jane Eyre has no magic spells, princes, dragons, or balls. She has to deal with real life in the real world of relationships. Because this is more like the world we live in, the audience, who has likely experienced jealousy and conflict in a relationship, is able to see themselves in the story.Alas, all is well in the end, once the real life struggles are over. This fairy tale ending is the perfect finishing to the story, because it what the reader `wants'. Though life doesn't always follow that pattern, sometimes it does. For Jane, something finally went right. Not many sentences in the novel provide as much joy as the simple declaration, ""Reader, I married him"" (462). Jane Eyre finds the love she has always wanted, and the reader, at that moment, experiences a small moment of triumph. That moment is the defining emotional moment of the novel, and what makes this novel so appealing to an audience. But, that is the same with any fairy tale.Because Jane Eyre does not simply focus on the `happily ever after', but integrates the story into a complicated and realistic plot, it is a more believable story. The book does not begin or end with the usual `Once upon a time"" and ""Happily ever after"", nor does it focus on the marriage and courtship between the two characters. Jane has struggles throughout the novel, from the abusive cousins to the malnutrition at school to nearly dying from exhaustion. Even after she marries Rochester, she must deal with a blind husband who is an emotional wreck. With small triumphs are placed intermittently between many struggles, it reflects what life is like for the audience, and anyone who lives in the real world, for that matter. Jane may have struggles, but she sees the fulfillments of her dream.Ultimately, those who live in the real world have the opportunity to escape into a book that isn't just about some perfect fictional character in a far away kingdom. Jane Eyre is about the same world we live in because it presents the struggles many of us face, and the triumphs that even plain Jane can experience. No matter what time you may be reading this novel, the breadth of the archetypes and the imperfections of the characters give you the opportunity to enjoy and relate to this beautifully crafted novel. If you have not had the privilege to read this book, do so at once! You will be rewarded by one of the most enriching and inspiring books out there.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Critique of Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who is a famous female novelist in England during nineteen century. This is also the first famous book she wrote. The book was written in Sheffield, England which is also the hometown of Charlotte. A lot of people consider this book Charlotte's autobiography. That's not exactly true but we still can find many personal experiences of Charlotte's in that book. The entire book's theme shows the values that humans should always live with dignity and love.The book tells a story about a woman named Jane Eyre. Jane was born in a very poor churchman's family and her parents died of enterotyphus when she was very young. She had to live in her uncle's family. Her aunt was a very mean and snobbish woman. She used a lot of ways to abuse Jane and even taught her child to bully Jane. Jane lived there for ten years, but she never yielded to her aunt so her aunt just treated her worse and worse. After Jane's uncle died, her aunt sent her to an orphanage. Although the life in the orphanage was still hard, and children there could not get enough food and the teachers treat them very curly, Jane got her first friend in the orphanage, a girl named Helen. Helen gave Jane much comfort and support but this happiness for her did not last too long; Helen also died by enterotyphus. After that the orphanage improved. Jane studied there for six years and taught there for two more years. Then she left the orphanage and was hired by the steward of Thornfield Hall as a tutor. Thornfiled was a big manor owned by Edward Fairfax Rochester. The life in Thornfield was good and after a long time Mr. Rochester spent with Jane, he was deeply attracted by Jane's dignified character. Jane also fell in love with Mr. Rochester. Before their marriage, bad news come, Jane was told that Mr. Rochester was already married and his violently insane wife was locked in Thornfield Hall. Jane could not bear this shock and left Thronfiled manor. Her life truned harder after she left Thornfield. After a few months later, a clergyman named St. John took Jane in and gave her a job teaching at a local school. One day, Jane got a large amount of money as inheritance from her dead uncle, which her aunt had been keeping from her, Jane also learned from her aunt that St. John is her cousin. At this time St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India to do missionary work. Jane refused him and realized she was still in love with Mr. Rochester so she decided to go back to him. When she came back to Thornfield Hall, it had already become a ruin. She was told that after she left, the insane woman set a fire in Thornfild Hall, and died during the fire. Mr. Rochester also was hurt during the fire. When Jane returned to him, he was not rich anymore and had become a poor disabled man. But Jane did not care about this at all; she found Mr. Rochester and married him.I strongly recommend Jane Eyre. This novel is very engaging. The plot of the novel is continuous and changes a lot. Every girl should read this book because it teaches you how to be an independent woman with dignity. There are so many characteristics of Jane's that are very valuable in today's society.When I first connected with Jane Eyre, I was a fairytale age girl. Strange thing was when my mother read the novel for me; I was fell in love with it very soon. The story was interesting and I was always curious about what's happen next. Little Jane's poor experiences and her brave impressed me deeply. Those contents really motivated me a strong sense of compassion which is really important for every child in their growth. I still remember when I knew that Jane was locked in a dark room by her aunt. I felt so worry about her and after her recovered form that disaster, I felt so happy for her. That's definitely a good lecture for me that how to share the same feeling with a friend. Little Jane also taught me that no matter how bad thing you experience, you should keep your heart pure and dignity, and always fight against unfair rules until you get the freedom. One more important thing I learned from the book is grasp every opportunity to study. Jane read a lot of book during she lived under her aunt abuse, she learned so much in the orphanage. The difference between Jane and others is she never gives up study or the process to enrich her inner world no matter how terrible the outside environment is. She successfully transfers her miserable live to her tenacious soul. All of these made her a thoughtful woman, and that also the reason for Mr. Rochester is attracted by Jane.The second time I read Jane Eyre was during my high school. At that period I was very depressed due to a heavy course load and a sharp competition. In an unexpected chance, I decided read Jane Eyre again. From I opened the book; I could not drop it any more. I finished it in three days. During I read the book, I felt so peaceful and calm. That's exactly what I needed for that period and I had lost this feeling for a long time. Beside my spiritual enjoyment, the book also gives me a strong influence on my value system. Until now, I still strongly believe that true love should build on the respect of each other. That's what Jane Eyre told me. This time I have a deeper understanding on the relationship between Jane Eyre and Edward Fairfax Rochester. At the beginning, Edward is a rich, strong and talented upper class man. But the real of him is a lonely heart, until he met Jane. A lot of women approach him in order of him money, but Jane is totally different. She did not care about him money or his social statue, she care about him just because she loves Edward and she really wants to comfort him from his painful experiences. Edward also loves Jane and appreciates her. He respects Jane and views her as his true friend in soul, he likes to talk with Jane and share his feeling with her. Their love is deep and stable. The ending of the story is not perfect but it's the best ending for Jane. She needn't choose from her love or her majesty. She obtains both of them. In the end, Edward became an old and poor blind man, but Jane still married with him. The only thing changed is they love each other deeper. This ending emphasizes Jane's characteristics as well as the substance of the book, which is the wroth of live should be respect and love.The negative part of Jane Eyre is the writer strength too much on Jane's insistence and independence. But in real world, things may much more complexes and cannot be overcome just by insistence and independence. However, I still believe Jane's characteristics will always shining in all times. Another negative echo for Jane Eyre is the book is not profundity enough. It only tells a story about a woman's life and her love experience, it did not tell enough about the time-background or the class contradiction. But I think that's just the reason that Jane Eyre do not bring too much heaviness to reader but the enjoyable feeling.All in all, I love the novel Jane Eyre. I believe everyone should read it; because it likes a cup of ice water, simple and clean, purify every reader's sprite.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Wow, this is my favorite book!","I love this book. I am a hopeless romantic and I read this book because it is a classic, but I thought it would be boring. I was so wrong. The love in this book is so good! I love how Mr. Rochester is so witty -he is so smart and i don't know, his wittiness just makes him really attractive. I love it how he is a bit out there and he is always asking for her hand, he shows simple ways that he wants Jane. I love how he was trying to make her jealous, I don't know why I just like it! I love how he treats her when they are together, like she is so precious to him. The way he explains his love, I just want to swoon and have someone say these things to me. He is a bit odd though, but it suited him. There were such funny moments between them also! Even though he is not described as handsome, It doesn't matter- the affection he feels for her is just beautiful, something which is hard to find. But he has a secret and things happen....I have read many romantic books and this is my all time favorite even though this isnt really classified as romance. This book doesn't have things that a romance book has like shagging scenes. That makes it all the better because the dialoge is so good that you don't need scenes like that. I love when the characters in a book really get to know eachother before they fall in love and in many romance books you won't find that. I take out this book almost every week to reread what I feel are the good parts; I look foward to doing that in free time that is how good it is. I don't know what your tastes are in books but this book is as good as it gets for me. There are times where it does get a bit slow, but I just love to read the bits with Jane and Mr. Rochester; they just make the book. I love the scene where she is leaving and he asks her about money; it is very funny.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The best that one can ever read.,"It is said that you accidentally trip on a stone and find it out to be a gem. Jane Eyre for me is something like tripping on a book full of gems. Never in my life, have I ever read for which my heart has so passionately cried, laughed and felt sad. Every page of this book is craftfully written to make you want read the next. Oh, from where does the author gets a vision to make someone cry over what are essentially black inked words. When Jane leaves Rochester to go to the Moors, my heart really sanked into an oblivion. And when she came back was overjoyed as though Jane Eyre is me. Right from the first page till the last, the author has painted a picture. One that induces you to travel with Jane from her childhood to adulthood. A piece of gem, one that you can cherish for ever. As a reviewer had written earlier, it is one that would force you to give up watching that stupid idiot box, it really does. At least it did that for me.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Cause and effect,"Someone below complained that only English teachers were giving this book 5-star ratings. And while I'm guilty of this, it's the other way around: I don't love this book because I'm an English teacher. I became an English teacher (in part) because I have always loved this book. I suspect there's been a school project somewhere requiring the class to write Amazon reviews of JE. If that's the case, hang in there, kids: it's a spooky, touching, dramatic story, well worth some of the less interesting bits (like the St. John subplot). Not all of you will like it, and yes, the language can be a bit difficult. (In case this shows up on the test, it's Victorian, not Old English--a difference of approximately 1000 years.) You don't have to love it or have it change your life. But it's a window into the literary tastes of the past (almost like 19th-C chick lit), which shaped and reflected pretty much all other ideology of the time. That's why it's important, and that's why a lot of people, even those who didn't have to read it (like me), continue to genuinely love it.My only problem is with the ending. It still bugs me that Jane can be so powerful and end up doing such a cop-out. I hate to think that Bronte was pandering to popular taste, but that's the only explanation I can think of.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Upon re-reading,"Odd, how re-reading a classic can become a meaningful experience. I'm sure I read Jane Eyre at least two times when I was in high school and again at college. Then there were the films, the most memorable being the one with William Hurt playing Rochester. Yet, last weekend when I was visiting friends and had nothing at hand, I looked at the first chapter and thought &quot;I've don't remember any of this,&quot; and was hooked.No wonder this book endures and no wonder that readers are entranced: it is an extraordinary story of an individual's struggle to live in a harsh world, find and create physical comfort and sustain an unacceptable love. Even though the story is intensely atmospheric (food, structures, furniture, temperature, clothes and flora are in constant reference), it is Jane herself who drives the story. Where she will find herself and what she will do next is the surprise. No wonder feminists were interested in this book: Jane never succumbs to anyone's idea of what she should do, she wrestles with decisions and bases her choices (that she insists on having choises is already delightful) on her own moral, social code. Hard choices she makes too and we wonder if she'll manage when, for example, she leaves Thornfield and finds herself forced to beg for food.The writing is sharp and intelligent and...funny too: take, for example, the little girls toppling off their stools during prayers, or the description of Adele's &quot;French&quot; personality. The plot is a stretch but a loveable one. Jane, we are told often, has neither beauty nor stature, the type of person that gets ignored in any social situation. However, this seemingly ineffectual person has two highbrow offers of marriage,inherits a fortune and reaps the bounty of a geniune, loving relationship with the one man who is her intellectual and emotional equal. Not bad for a poor, plain governess in the 1830s.Today, it might be that religion, scripture and even the idea of morality are concepts that carry too much weight for popular fiction. Jane, a level-headed girl, is neither silly nor preachy. That her thoughts are informed with the religious moral tone of the period makes this story more than a romance or tale of finding true love. It demonstrates how conviction is founded.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Long, but empowering","I throroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Although it was quite lengthy, it was filled with suspense and excitement. I feel that Jane Eyre was a strong, independent and proud character which makes her a great role model for women and children. From when she is only ten years old she already possesses courage, honesty and generosity despite her unpleasant life. Going to Lowood School only adds to her miserable childhood, but somehow she has the strength to overcome it and move on. Even though she is a poor, unattractive woman in the Victorian era she believes in economic and social equality. When she meets Rochester he is amazed at her intelligence, wit and frankness and though he is a man, she is his intellectual equal. When she realizes she must leaves Edward, she is able to resist the temptation of being with him to uphold her strong morals. This is also a very commendable quality that Jane Eyre possesses. Through her determination, she is able to survive poverty and loneliness and find a home with the Rivers. Here she exhibits true generosity when she divides her fortune among her new found friends. Again, she resists the temptation of a good home and safety and leaves St. John to find her lost love. Jane shows compassion when she decides to stay with Rochester for he rest of her life, and nurse him in his unhealthy state. Reading about a woman like Jane Eyre is very empowering and it makes you want to be a better person. Cudos to Charlotte Bronte for a novel very (long and) well written.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,A Fantastic Classic Romance,"Lost yet somewhat hopeful, Jane Eyre spent some of her child hood with an evil aunt after her parents had past. Troubled by the haunted shadows that lurk in her mind, young Jane decides that she needs change in her life. Slowly yet surely she does find some happiness which appears to be a struggle. The character, Jane, seems vulnerable throughout the telling of the story. At the age of eighteen, Jane finally presents herself in a newspaper as a governess. As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre is appointed as a governess at Thornfield Hall by the mysterious Mr. Rochester. Her integrity and independence are tested to the limit as their love for each other grows, and the secrets of Mr. Rochester's past are revealed.This story tells of a young woman, Jane Eyre, who makes modesty and plainness appear to be the most noble and admirable qualities in a young woman. She learned over time to be independent and had developed a strong mind. It's almost a romance novel underneath all the inner searching. She struggles through many obstacles and when faced with them, she does what is right for her and no one else. What I liked about it the most is that it was a real person's story to some extent. It glorified female independence and seemed almost like a fairy tale. Jane Eyre becomes someone because she puts in her best effort, not because of a wish, or a dream, or someone else's pity. She made herself beautiful in the way she saw fit.This incredible book brings detail of what's written and both love and sadness that people can relate to. An example of this would be Jane as she was experiencing friendship for the first time when she started school and then had lost someone she's close to. If you're a person who loves romance novels then I recommend this book to you. She is a great role model for women today. And this should be read if over the age of fourteen and up.",neutral

I got in trouble in 2 classes because i had been reading it under my desk until i reached a point (which was very rare) that i could put it down. I love Jane Eyre's way of thinking and how she trys to make her life as full as possible. I would recomend this to everyone!

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Rebel in Literature,"Despite general complaints of its monotonous dialogue, Jane Eyre continues to fascinate readers with dazzling morals embodied in an unlikely heroine--&quot;poor, obscure, plain, and little&quot;. Being a rebel among its contemporaries, Charlotte Bront&eacute; presents the detailed psychological aspects of human nature in the most deliberate manners.The novel itself has a very attractive story line with the orthodox format of &quot;good fictions&quot;-- gloomy mansion with dark mysteries lurking out, and a plain governess as the conqueror of all evil through the redemption of the soul of one man who's escaping from the past and from the truth. In this madly materialized society, Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time to continue embark echo in the heart and mind of the thoughtful.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte,"Jane Eyre is a suspensful novel that includes new excitements on every page. It is the story of a young orphan who is raised by her mean and unloving aunt who sends Jane away to Lowood boarding school at age ten. Lowood isn't the most loving place either. It is a charity school where all the students have lost at least one of their parents. This means that the conditions are far worse then other schools. These poor conditions result in a great erupion of typhoid within the school and many die at school or are sent home to die. Jane Eyre survives this however and stays at Lowood for eight years. She is a student there for six years, and a teacher for two. Then she decides that it is time to move on, and puts an ad in the paper for a job as a governess. Her ad is answered by Alice Fairfax. Alice Fairfax is the house keeper at Thornfeild and it is her job to also find a governess for the ward Adele. Thornfeild is owned by a man by the name of Edward Rochester. He offers money a job, a house, love, and everything else that money can buy to Jane, but it is still not enough for her. All through her life Jane has craved loving family and she is determined to find her relatives.After Jane learns the terrible secret of the attic she decides that she must find her way on her own. She leaves Thornfeild and travels by foot, and by carriage. She is turned into a beggar because she leaves many of her belongings in the parcel that she carlessly left on the carriage. When she is at the point of almost dying she is found on the door step of Moor house, where St. John brings her in and his sisters Mary and Diana help bring her back to good health. St. John gets her a job and a little cottage to live in. There Jane is almost as happy as she could be, but still something is missing. Will Jane ever find this one last element to make her life perfect?",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the finest heroines in literature,"I first read Jane Eyre when I was 9 at the recommendation of my 4th grade teacher. After that, I would always say that it was my favorite book. At 25, I looked back and wondered if I had really understood the book at age nine. So I reread it, and realized how deeply I had understood. The character of Jane had seeped into my subconcious as a role model against whom I unwittingly checked myself. She is level-headed, but not rigid. She falls into things, but is conscious while falling. She is neither a namby-pamby nor a Polyanna. She stands up for herself, while still respecting others. On top of all of that, she is very real. Her mental journey is recognizable to me, more so the older I get. The book is also swooningly romantic at times. Mr. Rochester is wonderful and arrogant, and vunerable, and grouchy. The conversations they have are beautiful, and fully engaging. This book will live inside me until the end of my days, and I'm so grateful.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Addictive book,"When I first read Jane Eyre in high school, my initial reaction was one of ennui. I thought the book was a little slow with a heroine in serious need of some self-esteem lessons. However, after I finished it, I found myself wanting to read it again, and again, and again! Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence. Oh, well, I guess its too late to mention the criticism to Charlotte!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Cannot find the words to do justice,"Let me first note that I am still in high school but I didn't read this as an assignment. So far in the past couple of years I have had to have read numerous boks in a modern day point of view and I have just become so sick of all of these stereotypical plots. Girl finds boy, they fall in love, save the day, the end.But when i read this book I was so awakened, so jarred into the brutality of reality that I was fascinated by Ms.Bronte's writing and frank honesty of everything.It was disturbing, witty, insightful, and overall captivating. Nothing ese really compares to this classic. I was sometimes lost at points and was forced to look back. It was philosophical and even though it didn't have much elegance, it was charming. It showed loss, failure, a world without love. Jane Erye is like nothing I've ever read before.I know several people criticized the way Bronte took away all love from Jane's world. But to me it just made everything so much more worthwhile; whenever Jane got the slightest shred of kindness i truly felt it considering all of the hardships he went through.His review cannot do the justice that i wish i could explain but the book was just so amazing i cant put them into words. Please take my word for it and read this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Why'd I wait so long?,"I'm not sure what made me - at 37 - decide to read Jane Eyre. It's obviously been around my whole life. And it seems like the type of book I should have been forced to read -- if not in high school then surely in college. But I'm so glad I finally got around to it.Jane thoroughly frustrated me throughout the book and I actually found myself yelling at the book in much the same way I yell at the Buffalo Bills whenever they do something stupid (every game they play). I also found myself hoping for certain outcomes which is funny considering the ending was written oh so long ago.Jane Eyre is a love story. But more than that, its a story of perseverance, and dedication to principles.About half way through, I convinced my 15-year-old daughter that she had to read it -- just so I would have someone to talk to about it ... and because I knew she'd love it like I do.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Not what I expected,"Some spoilers are inevitable below, if you don't already know the basic plot.As part of a new series of Goodreads challenges, it was required of me to read Jane Eyre, and I wasn't too thrilled. I've started it before and never penetrated too far. But it was in exchange for the other person watching half of Firefly (it's a shared challenge - two of us read a book apiece in exchange for all the episodes), so ... I will do a great deal for Mal Reynolds, I said.I have a paperback, somewhere, but wound up reading it via literature.org for some reason - where, I should warn, there are a great many typos, and a startling use of all caps where I believe the original uses italics. It's odd to see Mr. Rochester exclaim in the manner of a web post.I was surprised at how very much I enjoyed this. The language has proven a barrier in the couple of times I've started it in the past - no patience for it, or something. But this time having to read it out of Browncoat devotion combined with the right mood and receptivity, and I clicked with it. The sense of humor of Jane and therefore of Charlotte Bront was a wonderful surprise; there was a snark and sarcasm and a touch of simple silliness which for some reason I never suspected in either Bront or book. My prejudgment of the book was purely as a girl's dark and Gothic ""tale of woe"", built with archaic language - and that is a big part of it, yes. (After all, Helen at fourteen is given lines like ""she gives me my meed liberally"" and ""collecting all she says with assiduity"", which simply leaves me wondering if children actually did speak this way in 1847, and my goodness has civilization degenerated if they did). But it's also fun, especially when Jane converses with Mr. Rochester.""Am I hideous, Jane?""""Very, sir: you always were, you know.""""St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.""(Aside.) ""Damn him!""--Jane as a child: Poor little precocious wretch. She's obviously much smarter and sharper and more thoughtful (in terms of giving thought to things more than solicitous; she is that, but not overwhelmingly so) than everyone around her - never an easy situation even for someone with a sweet disposition. Jane does not have a sweet disposition. This is undoubtedly due in part to how she's been treated all her life by the Reeds, but she fights fire with fire, no question. She's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.And that's kind of a surprise. I haven't read so very much 19th century literature, but I have some familiarity with the stuff - and in my limited experience there weren't very many pre-Jane heroines like Jane. I'm thinking of course of Little Nell, the sweet and uncomplaining little orphan of The Old Curiosity Shop, who may or may not be the archetype, and also the much put-upon Fanny Price.Jane Eyre ain't no Little Nell. In fact what just struck me is that she is, in many ways, identical to the pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter. (Someone somewhere has to have done a study of orphans in young adult literature, a comprehensive list and investigation into why they're so prevalent. I can think of half a dozen immediately - Jane, Harry, Anne, Heidi, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield - and Pip. Seven. And then there are all the poor motherless ones, who are probably double in number.) Jane doesn't blow up her aunt, but she does attack her cousin. Her presence was resented, only tolerated out of duty to the dead, and she was ill-treated by everyone in the house to one degree or another, particularly by her male cousin. School came as a surprising solace - at least I was surprised, because again the impression I had formed was a terrible one, all Snape and no Gryffindor. And it actually wasn't. Even at its worst it was well-intentioned and there were positives; once it received reforming attention it improved drastically.It is in some ways so very much a product of its time, with its solid Christianity and its xenophobia (""a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects"") - but Jane is a creature of the book's future. Mr. Rochester was incorrect: Jane was not a fairy. She was a time traveler. (Now I want to write that version. Never mind Jane Slayr, this is better.) She is independent, or wants very badly to be, and she is strong in ways women are not expected nor really desired to be in 1847. She has wings, and wants to spread them; the horizon line is too confining for her. And somehow it feels very modern that she is uncertain of her footing when people are kind to her, that she is in some ways more comfortable with rudeness, and can stand up for herself quite well in its face.At this remove, without a lot of research, I don't know if the Gothic themes in this book would have been something its contemporary audience would have been familiar with; my impression is that they would. The ""madwoman in the attic"" was apparently a time-worn plot device even then. In a way it was more fun reading it with a fair idea of the ending - even though I've never read it before I knew much of the plot. Even knowing the spoilers, it had some deliciously creepy moments, and Jane never succumbed to the usual behaviors of the swoon-prone Gothic heroine. She acquitted herself quite well.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Problems with this Kindle version?,"I'd give the book itself 4 or 5 stars, the 3 star rating is because this Kindle version is a little flawed.'Jane' is sometimes spelled 'Janet' which is a little annoying, but not that bad.One thing I'm unsure of is whether or not this version is incomplete on place names... I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time. Jane would be considered somewhat feisty by today's standards.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre -- Wow!,"This was my first Charlotte Bronte novel, and I want to read it again and again!

Very suspenseful, entertaining and intriguing.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!,"This is my first time reading any classic (im 33yrs old). I was always afraid that I would not be able to understand the language of the time well enough to enjoy the story..WAS I SORELY WRONG! I am a beginner reader and I did just fine after the first 30 pages. This was such a dark read that I do not recommend it for everyone but I enjoy dark, gothic love stories. I also love Mr. Rochesters way of drawing out Jane from her own self imprisonment of her spirit. I suggest everyone to read this atleast once and then see the new movie out! I just saw the movie today and it was the best yet!! Mia played the part of Jane SOOO WELL!! I was just mad that they left the gypsy scene out,,that was my favorite in the book.I must warn however that this particular copy of the book has extremelly small and strange print which was okay for my eyes but I can see older people having an issue.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,This is why the classics still matter,"Jane Eyre is utterly incredible. The expression ""page-turner"" usually isn't associated with Victorian literature, but Charlotte Bronte created just that when she penned this masterpiece. With a fast-paced plot and a couple jaw-dropping surprises, Jane Eyre is a fascinating read. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys literature of the very highest quality.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Great Love Story,"Not intended for the melancholy, this classic literature is full of hope, full of love that you rarely find in writings those days. Jane Eyre, a plain and poor girl, a cast out among her known rich relatives, tried to make her way in this world when she advertised for governess position and received a call from Thornfield Hall. In this place, she was presented with a very agreeable student and company, Mr. Edward F. Rochester. The courting game began slowly but surely towards Jane who was still a naive girl of eighteen. Together they overcame their differences such in age and had planned to be married soon. But a terrible secret broke out and Jane fled from the Hall, leaving her crushed love behind. In her sanctuary, she found another kind of suitor in the form of a cousin, St. John Rivers. She loved him as a brother and she thought the feeling is mutual until a proposal came and the true character of St John revealed but still with power to control her resolution, in the name of his holy purpose. Right at that moment, a supernatural thing happen (which I guarantee will cause your hair stand on end) that called her back to the beloved Thornfield Hall and its master. I don't think this event was out of place. In fact, it served as the last, elegant seal on the round up.A profound love story with two unlikely characters. No beauty beyond compare and no handsome prince 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Through this tale, Ms Bronte also conveyed her opinion and principle about love, marriage, physical display, conceited faith, gender equality and sound educated mind, especially of women.Her style in expressing the main characters' personality and principal was a thorough exploration of the mind and heart without too much side comments which often sidetracked a narrative. Expressive dialogs and vivid description were her main strengths that I like most. Though it is still consistent with the writing style of its era, it will reward satisfactorily every modern reader who faithfully peruses its chapters.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My very favorite book,"Jane Eyre has been my favorite since I first read it way back in middle school, the 6th grade I believe. I loved it then and I continue to love it. Jane is a remarkable heroine, she is not beautiful or charming, she is quite and bookish. She goes from a smart abused child to a smart stronge young woman. She has hope and bravery when she has no reason to believe in happy endings and that is why I love her. I do love her, for being to my mind one of the strongest female characters written and she does it all without batting her eyes. Not even once. This book may be listed as a romance, but it is also a mystery and a drama. I would highly recommended it for character building.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A CLASSIC REVISITED - DON'T MISS IT !,"Many are familiar with the story of the orphaned Jane Eyre. If they haven't read Charlote Bronte's story, they may have seen one of several film versions (my personal favorite being the pairing of Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles). Nonetheless, this classic Gothic tale holds such an important place in the annals of literature that if no introduction is necessary it more than merits revisiting. The audio book edition produced by Penguin Classics and read by Joanna David offers just that opportunity. It's a chance to be introduced to an unforgettable tale or to see the familiar in a new light through the estimable voice performance given by Ms. David.David, an accomplished actress, has experience in the classics - she appeared in a televised version of Pride and Prejudice and played the young Mrs. de Winter in the BBC adaptation of Rebecca. She carries listeners through Jane's resignation, incredulity, dismay, and happiness with an assured, insightful performance.Quite briefly, we meet Jane when she is living with a wealthy but unkind aunt. After being locked in a room where her uncle died, Jane is sent away to a charity boarding school. Regrettably, her lot is not improved as the school's headmaster is a cruel, selfish man who deprives the students while providing luxuries for his own family. When, at last, he is replaced, Jane days are happier and she even remains at the school to teach.Following that, she takes a position as governess at Thornfield Manor where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. When, to her amazement, he proposes, she happily accepts. Her joy is short lived as she discovers that he is already married, to a mad woman kept locked on the third floor of Thornfield Manor. Distraught and miserable, Jane runs away.After suffering all forms of deprivation, Jane is taken in by a kind family and finds work at a school. Then, almost unbelievably she comes into a small fortune left to her by an Uncle. She also receives another marriage proposal, but knows that there is only one man that she truly loves. Few will forget the sound of Mr. Rochester's voice calling to Jane over the moors.This audio edition of Jane Eyre offers an extraordinary listening experience - don't miss it!- Gail Cooke",positive

I would recommend this novel for age 14+ I dont think others younger than this age would most likley enjoy it. I personally loved this story at parts the book does drage on with Bronte's many many descriptions.

Although it is something that I might be asked to read in an English class, this is my favorite book ever and I have read it many times. Nice and thick and full of details, it paints a colorful image of life in England during that time period.This book shows the struggles of poor, unwanted Jane, first in the Lowood charity school, then in her search to find a family that will hire her as a governess. This is how she ends up at Thornsfield Hall, employed by Mr. Rochester, a man who is old enough to be Jane's father. Despite this fact, Jabe slowly falls in love with him.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"try it, you might like it!","I read this about two years ago, and was initially put off by it's length and the fact it was 'a classic'. Really, though, once you get into it you are in for a treat. The book is an emotional rollacoaster, and though it was written more than a hundred and fifty years ago (I think) it still heldgreat resonance for me; I too could identify with Jane Eyre's dilema over the cerbral duty prescribed by her mind and the emotinal neccessity calling out from her heart. The chemistry between her and Rochester blows away anything you'd see on the cinema screen, and the passages where they are together practically set the pages on fire. I guess it's down to the readers temperment in the end, wether or not they emaphise, and the style is nuanced and therefore could be thought overly wordy ocaissionally, but if you like reading this is such a good book to try.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Raging emotions, strident feminism...COOL!","JANE EYRE is a novel of destroyed conventions. At nearly each and every turn within its pages, there is some rule, some assumption of character and plot destroyed. In JANE EYRE, women fight back against tyrannical husbands, governesses `look above their stations', mothers are absent and men are punished for their subjugation of women. Not content to only poke at society through the safety of a fictional character, Bronte also confronts literary conventions, constructing JANE EYRE as a Bildungsroman about a WOMAN, and an UNATTRACTIVE woman to boot. Is nothing sacred? NO. And this is what makes JANE EYRE such a wonderful read. Looking for just great wit, nascent feminism and in general a pretty good story addled with a few boring inanities about day-to-day life? Go buy a Jane Austen novel. JANE EYRE is nearly the antithesis of orderly Austen, a passionate display of feelings and emotions that would have made Austen's EMMA blush, a full-blown rebellion against the societal constraints upon women.""Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties...they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves..."" Within these few scathing lines is contained almost the entire sociological crux of the novel. For Jane, though outwardly calm as ""women are supposed to be"", is often raging inside at various acts of injustice perpetrated upon her. Sometimes she releases her feelings and vents, other times she swallows it ""as women are supposed to"" do. At this period of time, women in the upper class were mostly ornaments. When men spoke of their accomplishments, they meant things like a woman's ability to speak French, or her grace while playing a piano. Her business acumen would most likely not be counted an accomplishment, but a detraction, a manifestation of too spirited a personality, or too lively a mind. Hopeful mammas made sure that their little girls learned all the correct dances, could play an instrument and sing, or embroider, NOT complete ledgers. Bronte is urging that her fellow women not be confined to the pursuit of such activities, but allowed to exercise their minds and emotions in whatever direction they might want to...and in 1841!It's a wild ride that never ceases to be entertaining. Don't miss JANE EYRE.",positive

I feel that this story was better that some, because it was based on real life experiences from the life of the author, Charlotte Bronte.The story has a good amount of suspense that keeps the reader wanting to find out what happens next.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys old English books from the late 1800's, and to romance novel readers!~SUMMARY~Jane Eyre is orphaned as an infant, and left to the guardianship of her Aunt Reed. There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night. These are said to be the doings of a drunken servant named Grace Poole.Jane then receives a letter from Gateshead Hall, telling her that Mrs. Reed is requesting Jane to come visit her on her death bed. There she learns that a distant Uncle Eyre wished to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed replied saying that Jane died in the Typhus epidemic.Jane returns from Gateshead Hall 3 weeks late because of funeral arrangements for her aunt to an anxious Mr. Rochester, who feared her to never return. Later, in the garden, he asks Jane to marry him, and she gladly accepts, to the dismay of Mrs. Fairfax.The wedding was interrupted by a man who announced that Mr. Rochester was already married! Mr. Rochester then confesses as he brings the wedding attendees up to his attic. There he shows everyone his ""wife:"" Bertha Mason, an insane and deadly violent woman, looked over by Grace Poole. She is kept there because Mr. Rochester doesn't have the heart to send her to an asylum.In her dismay, Jane runs away from Thornfeild Hall. Leaving her belongings in a stage coach by accident, she has no other option other than to become a beggar or die on the streets.She finnally is taken into the Rivers residence. Here St. John, and his 2 sisters care for her, and she becomes like one of the family. She later learns that John Eyre (the uncle from the letter) has died and left Jane his fortune.

The author grasps you into the story, with the delightful romance and the plot elements here and there, it is put together very coherently.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my All-time Ultimate Favourites!,"Jane Eyre is definitely on my list of top novels. I have read it quite a few times and I have enjoyed it each time. Actually Charlotte Bronte was being quite daring in creating this heroine. Jane was a new development in fiction during the time of the writing of this novel (1847). Jane was intelligent, passionate and totally unconventional. The other characters in this novel are just as memorable. Who can forget Rochester - broody, moody, and somewhat sinister? The plot of the book is exciting and it carries the reader along with a sense of urgency. This is an enduring novel that I continue to love and enjoy.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Absolutely Wonderful,"A true classic. In this not so typical love story, the heroine, Jane Eyre is unlike any other. As opposed to the archetypal heroine, Jane is simple in both demeanor and appearance. She is a modest young woman who has been raised with much turmoil and tragedy, but despite this is able to deeply care for others. A deep and mysterious romance develops between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the man whom employs her as a governess. But will it last? Will a mystifying secret destroy their relationship and leave Jane with another emotional scar? This book is quite the page-turner, you will not be able to put it down for the anticipation of what comes next. Bronte evokes strong, intimate emotions within the reader that give hope and motivation to love in life to the fullest. The character of Jane proves that any one can be a heroine, no matter what your physical appearance or character, that any woman is capable of being loved and of vast romance. A must-read-feel-good-book.",positive

It is fun to read about two characters, Jane Eyre, with her kind and charming but simple personality and the moody and mysterious Mr. Rochester.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My All Time Favorite!,"This is the book that hooked me on reading! It has everything that I enjoy reading about: strong female characters, mysterious and preternatural occurrences, secret romances, and indelible love.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Best review. Read this one!,"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre whisks you away to a world of thoughtful detail and slowly evolving love. Although at times the journey is excruciatingly slow, Bronte makes up for that with her strong-willed heroine, Jane.Jane is not your average heroine. At first glance she is a quiet, boring, and tractable girl, but underneath lays an increasingly strong, virtuous, and independent young woman. After years of knowing only a quiet obedience and a passive submission, Jane finally discovers her true nature when she stands up to the Reeds and demands release from their cruel care. In another display of personal strength, through an effort of pure will and a moral code that allows no compromise, Jane gives up security and a life time of happiness and leaves Mr. Rochester to embark on an uncertain path which promises hardship and grief. Jane's moral integrity along with her steadfast and courageous character is what made this story famous. Jane reveals these qualities again and again in the unfolding story, which makes her more and more admirable. She foregoes marriage to St. John and honorable service as a missionary to stick to her beliefs. Also, Jane does not conform to the expectations of the time. Jane is not content to be used once and then forgotten. Originally, Jane was dependent on Mr. Rochester, playing the traditional subordinate female role. However, in the end when they are finally together forever, Mr. Rochester becomes dependent on Jane, and that is just how she likes it. She wants to play an active and vital role in her husband's life. Bronte did an excellent job creating an admirable character in Jane Eyre.When Jane arrives at Thornfield, serving as a poor and lowly governess, she immediately falls in love with her wealthy master. Bronte enriches the reader's experience of their love with long passages describing Jane's conflicting emotions. Such endearing moments add credibility to the author's claims about Jane's strength of character. As their relationship unfolds, tantalizing hints and subtle foreshadowing grip the audience in suspense and hope that perhaps Mr. Rochester loves Jane too. For instance, Mr. Rochester says, ""'Goodnight my --"", and Bronte adds, ""He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me"". Although cheesy, such moments are effective in holding the reader's attention.Despite the novel's many charms and merits, at times I found myself wanting to rip my hair out at its agonizingly slow pace. My annoyance and impatience were magnified towards the story's end when Jane joins the River's household. Perhaps Bronte slows the story down purposely to contrast the speed and excitement of Jane and Rochester's relationship to its opposite in Jane and St. John's plodding relationship. Whatever the reason, the story takes a downward plunge as soon as Jane steps inside River's door.I also had a problem with the ending. Bronte concludes by quoting St. John's letter, ""Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus!"" This is Jane's book, possibly Mr. Rochester's, but never St. John's! The last words are hardly relevant to the story. Sure, faith in God is a reoccurring theme, but hardly last word material. Bronte made a mistake; she should have either ended with Jane or Mr. Rochester saying something about love. Isn't love what this whole story is about!?Still, the good outweighs the bad in Jane Eyre, and I highly recommend it. Anyone who craves a dark love story between two very unlikely characters and possesses enormous patience should pick this book up immediately!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,STILL HOLDS UP BEAUTIFULLY...,"...after 160+ years.THE STORY:I read Jane Eyre every 3-4 years because its truly the grading curve for so many writers of the genre. There are times even now when I read the book and I'll say to myself, ""I LOVE this book!""When you think of the date in which it was written in and the author's limited worldly experience and resources, you can't help but appreciate her sharp wit and thoughtful insight into each character. In addition to that, Bront has a way of transporting you into Thornfield's dark eerie halls alongside Jane. It's truly a remarkable story!THE BARNES AND NOBLES CLASSICS EDITION:As for this particular edition, for quite some time I had been encouraging a friend to read Jane Eyre. The compact size was perfect for her to carry around in her bag for long grocery store lines, commuter rides, etc. She finished all 608 pages in one day because she loved it! It also has a great introduction filled with historical and bibliographical information on Ms. Bront to truly transport the reader into the mind and time of Jane Eyre.**If you simply want more Mr. Rochester and Jane after reading this, I suggest seeing the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke made for TV version by the BBC. Out of all versions (and I've seen all) it is the TRUEST adaptation of Bronte's work and doesn't dumb down her beautiful prose (what the author is most famous for) with modern day slang, nor does it take liberties with Bronte's Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre to bring them down to Hollywood's standards. The strong characters you fell in love with while reading her book, are the same strong characters in this wonderful screen adaptation. Bronte would be proud as was this reader/viewer.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Jane Eyre: Modern Illustrations, Modern Take","This copy of Jane Eyre, ""The Illustrated Jane Eyre"", from Penguin Classics, is a truly lovely book to read, and look at. The illustrations by Dame Darcy, bring a modern, fearless, and unique look and feel to a very old story. I've read ""Jane Eyre"" three times, so it is one of my favorite novels. Of the copies I've read, the illustrations in this one really do the story justice: a modern, gifted, gutsy artist bringing new blood to the novel of a gifted, gutsy writer named Charlotte Bronte.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I could not put this book down!,"I bought this book about 10 years ago, and I did not read it till last year, i could not put this book down, This book is so relevant to a woman's heart, to the human being's gemotions, What I love about Jane Is that she always kept fighting through all her trials and never let hate poison her heart, always made the best of everything. I bought the miniseries from BBC, I recommend Pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility by Jane Austen to those who love this genre.Nobody writes this way anymore!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,An enjoyable read,"Jane Eyre was a clever book that brought you through the twists and turns of her obscure life. Beginning from childhood, Jane was faced with the choices of life which lay before her. She moved from struggle to struggle with courage and self-determination which gained the reader's respect. Her character is strong and clever in a way that brings her to be a heroic personage in the novel. I liked how Jane obtained a strong-willed personality and how she stuck by her beliefs no matter what.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this slower paced romance from beginning to end and like many other books of its kind, it captivated me with the beloved mixture of romance and challenge. I liked how there was a fair amount of lovey-dovey moments in the book which held your attention, and made you strive for more. It wasn't a constant shower of romance and flirtatious quotes, and this I found, allowed the reader to excite themselves whenever the romance was present.Charlotte Bront used a lot of descriptive imagery throughout the novel ranging from the texture of light to the precise emotions Jane was feeling. This seemed to make it easier on many levels to comprehend exactly what was going on at every point of the novel. Although it had a few sluggish parts, I found was no struggle to read through those select scenes. The beginning of the book had a slow start, but I believe it was necessary to set up the stage for the rest of the novel. As a final comment, I'd like to simply state that I really enjoyed reading Jane Eyre.",positive

I'm not sure about the rest of the reviewers, but this book has changed my life. It is a little boring during the first few chapters, but don't get discouraged, it gets so good, you can't put it down. I read it during school, and I cryed when the bell rang! It was so riveting!

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,The freedom of finding true love,"The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Greatest Novel Ever,"Words simply can't express how much I love this book. I have Three different copies of the book, I own all of the movie versions that I could find of it (Four, as of now). To say that I am a fan is a huge understatement.Jane is such a great character, a survivor in every sense of the word. She loves her man, but he doesn't own her, no no! She's her own woman, and she makes sure that he knows it. One of my favorite scenes of the book is when Edward is trying to force gifts on Jane, and she gets increasingly annoyed about it. He sees that she is upset and tries to sweet talk her, but she brushes him off completely. You go girl.The emotions in this story are gut wrenching, especially the scene after the botched wedding ceremony. I feel for Jane and understand her despair, but I weep openly for Edward. All he has ever wanted in life is to find someone he can love who will love him back, and just when he finds her she's ripped away. Oh, my! I'm getting teary-eyed just thinking about it!READ THIS BOOK!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Dark Romance,"Jane Eyre is a timeless work that, once investigated outside of your high school english class, has the power to pull you into a world defined by social classes and the acts humans will perform for love.As you enter the world of Jane you realize that love and strength are intertwined deeply. You become aware that love is never simple and only the strong will survive. I will only go into the briefest details because to give anything away would be to steal a very meaningful experiance from the reader.The first time I read this novel I didn't really see the depth of the piece. You follow a young woman striking out into the world working a lower class job for an upper class family. As the governess at Thornfield Hall Jane becomes entangled with Mr. Rochester's dark secrets, and she also begins to find her heart intangled with his in a way that would disrupt the social order of the time. Yet, as you progress through this story you understand every choice Jane must make, even ones that seem so difficult and painful.Yes, at times it's melodramatic and very dark.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Enormous in scope and vastly entertaining.,"Jane Eyre is one of the best books I've ever read. It was not at all what I expected from an old English novel writen in 1847. I now see why it has been around so long. It is not stuffy and wieghted down with endless babble about manners as most English novels are. It moves along at a speed that keeps you enthralled. Jane Eyre is in a class by inself and has everything you could want in a novel: mystery, intrigue, romance, action, and endless, strong, intelligent drama. Jane Eyre captures your heart. You root for her happeness and truely believe she deserves true love. Revolutionary and richly imagined, Jane Eyre is at least a century ahead of its time; an ultimately triuphant work of genius.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Classic with enduring presence,"Struggle, survival, compassion and romance: these eternal elements will make this novel an enduring presence. Ms. Bronte must have been quite courageous to write about a free spirited woman like Jane Eyre in Victorian Era. Even though there are so many memorable scenes in this book, what stands out most is the romance between Jane and Edward. The pathos underlying this romance reminds me of the desperate love that Hunchback of Notre Dam professed towards Esmeralda.

Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story. It is a great book to read when you are unhappy. It will cheer you right up. It has a great story line, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates classics.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Addictive book,"When I first read Jane Eyre in high school, my initial reaction was one of ennui. I thought the book was a little slow with a heroine in serious need of some self-esteem lessons. However, after I finished it, I found myself wanting to read it again, and again, and again! Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence.

I thought the book was a little slow with a heroine in serious need of some self-esteem lessons. However, after I finished it, I found myself wanting to read it again, and again, and again! Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence. Oh, well, I guess its too late to mention the criticism to Charlotte!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Really great!,I'm in third grade and I do a lot of reading. I find this book amazing and well written. I can relate to Jane Eyre because when she was young in the book that's how I feel sometimes. Sad. But after reading this book I've been happier because theres hope.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My favorite!!!!!,"A good friend of mine has long been a fan of the work of the Bronte sisters and encouraged me to read this. I was surprised at what a touching story it was! If you love the sensation of falling in love all over again, look no further than this novel. I could read it over and over again and never be tired of it! The strong-willed Jane Eyre is a role model for any woman.When hunting for good reading, this is classical literature at its best. Read it, you won't be able to put it down.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Classic for a Reason,"Who doesn't love Jane and Rochester. You grow to love Jane for being herself in a world that expects beauty from the outside. It's tragic at times when you read about Rochester's unhappy life, but the ending just makes it all better!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the greatest novels ever written!,"I have already written a review for this book. Actually, I wrote it several months ago. However, I found one review that disturbed me. The reviewer said, and I quote, &quot;Thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionbale female readers.&quot;Okay, now here is my opinion on that statement. I have read Jane Austen and I absolutely adore all of her novels (Mansfield Park I cannot speak for, I have never read it.) However, I find that her heroines are not to be admired. Take for instance, Anne Elliot in Persuasion who spends 8 years in a state of depression and makes her self ugly because she made a mistake. Or Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, who is much to prejudiced to even hear Mr. Darcy's side of the story. And don't forget Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey who almost scares herself to death romantizing every little detail in an old house just because she has read too much. Then there is Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility who is so concerned with dying for love that she can't see that the man of her dreams is right in front of her face and she falls in love with some jerk. And last, but not least, Elinor Dashwood, Marianne's elder sister, who closes up her emotions inside and because of that eventually snaps. Jane Eyre, on the other hand is a heroine to be admired, for she shows us all that even in the worst situations of life (which she experienced) you can still be strong. Jane Austen's characters may live the fairytale &quot;happily ever after&quot; life, but they do not prove as strong as Jane Eyre in the least.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,WARNING....,"This is my absolute favorite book! WARNING:it starts out slow, but stay with it and you will find this to be an excellent book. If you like classics and romance (clean romance) this is the book for you.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre - a love story of two average people.,I think Jane Eyre is a wonderful book because of its characters. The book shows great love between two different people.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"I loved it, instantly became my personal favorite.","I loved Jane Eyre. I've read it at least 6 six times since I first read it in February. I've seen two movie versions of this book and sadly neither did Charlotte Bronte's wonderful romance justice. I enjoyed this book's romantic story line. I'd received this book as a present but never read it because I thought it looked long and boring, but boy was I wrong. I started the book on a Friday of a four day weekend and didn't sleep until I'd finished it. This book would make a great movie, but only if you keep all the crucial things in it. Most have sadly left out crucial points. I highly recommend this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Very good, it is a classic","I had to read this book for summer reading before I started my high school. I am almost frinished it. At first, I was upset that I would have to read it because I thought it would be boring dribble. It honestly wasn't. Sometimes the details make the plot a little blury, but I still enjoyed it. I would recommend anyone who has to read it to read it with an open mind so you can enjoy everything it gives you.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,wonderful-touching-wow!,"If u dont mind the thinkness of a book, Jane Eyre should be next on ur list. I read this book because it was on my 11th grade summer reading list. I am happy I choice it. Although lots of wonderful romance is involved, Jane goes through so much, that you feel happy that she finally found someone. When you think its the end...something else happends. A must read!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Best Book I have ever read,This book is my all time favorite. It combines Bronte's amazing writing ability and one of the best love story plots ever!,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,"A little boring, I recomend seeing the movie","I had to read the book for school, and found it extremely boring. The book may just not be my style. Bronte gets too caught up in details.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my favorites,"After reading the book for a class, I found it to be one of my favorite books. I read the first few pages and was convinced it was going to be a boring book. Yet the more I read, the harder it was for me to put down. I was hooked with all the twist and turns of the book.It was a book that was worth reading through all the boring pages. You must read it!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,&lt;sigh&gt;,"Jane Eyre is a must. Have read it 5 times, and will again soon. Bronte's writing is accessible to everyone, yet still maintains un &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; not found in modern books.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,This Novel deserves 10 stars!,"Jane Eyre has been my favorite novel since I was 12 years old and every single time I read it again it just gets better and better. If you like reading good mysteries, biographies, and romance than Jane Eyre is your book. Charlotte Bronte spectacularly captures the emotions and feelings of the characters and creates a strong and independent lead.It's just wonderful, amazing, and the best book I've ever read.What are you doing reading this... you should have downloaded Jane Eyre and started reading it already.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Great Classic!,"I must say, Iam quite pleased with the book that I recieved. Perfect condition,Follow Jane Eyre through her trials and tribulations with her beginings at Lowood school to the elusive Mr. Rochester!We Love Jane, you will too..I won't give away the secrets ...you'll have to read for yourself!ENJOY!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte,I love this book. The section on St John is like a mini novel within the book. Bronte has in depth character development and uses each to the fullest. I regret the editors of the original submission deleted all reference to her prowess as a La Crosse player while at the Institution. That would have made her physical strength more understandable. One of my favorites. Also bought copies for two granddaughters for Christmas.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am so grateful for this illustrated edition!,"I think that it is great book. I had read it translated in Russian when I was about 14 or 15 years old. I loved the dark suspense and romance story. For a few years already I tried to introduce this book to my daughter with no success. Until she came across this illustrated version with the font that someone else complained here about. :) Funny, but ""gothic-like"" illustrations in Tim Burton style and wiggly font attracted my 15 years old child. I am very greatful that classic book had been re-introduced in a way that she could relate to it.The language is not simple. I found a good solution for my daughter. I uploaded Kindle version of the book for her. She uses it to search for words' definitions. Kindle version also allows to highlight words and find them throughout the book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Paramount,"After reading this book, my life changed. I was move buy Jane, deeply. I can't find any novel better than this one, and it's the best book for preparing the SAT.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Couldn't stop reading,"This was definitely challenging for me to read because of the large and ancient vocabulary, but luckily with the Kindle I can easily look up the definition of every unknown word. Even though I did not entirely understand the words used, I became involved in the book emotionally so that I understood how the character, Jane Eyre, felt. I related to the book based on my teenage dating years and fell in love with the story and the poetic writing. This is an excellent book and anyone who has given it less than 5 stars doesn't understand the book and does not want to take the time to understand.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre rated,Captivating from the start......pulls you in and takes you back in history for a remarkable adventure. Excellent way to start reading with my kindle. Very impressed with the free five star book!,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Compelling and thoughtful,"It's a great piece of work, and a joy to read. I read it once as a student in high school, and I must say, it's better to read as an adult. Truly fills your eyes and heart to the brim-- no one will close this book and feel that it was time wasted. This is the first Kindle edition book I have read, and it won't be the last. Consider me hooked.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Wonderful!,"The introduction includes a dedication and thanks to William Makepeace Thackery, author of Vanity Fair. Bronte and Thackery both admired the enormous capability of women even if not recognized by nineteenth century society. Jane Eyre, and Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair, are both strong women but in different ways. Jane is selfless, innocent, filled with love and yet heroic. Becky uses people. And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person. She reminds me of Dorthea of Middlemarch.This wonderful book should be read by one and all!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"Still a classic! I enjoyed the English of the 1840's. Some of the chapters, however, were a little long and became a bit tedious. Did the really talk like that? With the Kindle dictionary, I had to look up at least three unknown words per page to find out the old-style language.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyer,"This is the 3rd time I've read this book. As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier. Basically, the plot is a bodice ripper without the ribald sexual description (thank God).There is something contained, passionless and distant about Jane that disconnects as you read from the larger narrative,none the less I recommend this book as a good read - just don't expect Wuthering Heights",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,Why did I wait until I was 57 years old to read this book? Wonderful story every page of the way.,positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,This classic is witty and thought provoking. The plot is twisty enough to entertain the most experienced reader; you may guess the ending but not the path to it.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,What a treasure!!!,"Wow! I am 34 and had never heard of this book. Midway through, I told my mother about this awesome book I was reading and she said it used to be required reading when she was a girl!

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my favs,"This is one of most favorite books ever. If you like Jane Austen's books, then I suggest this one. I love British Literature, and this book exceeded my expectations. A wonderful classic, and free too! Nothing to lose.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"Hard to get into (&oacute;ld fashioned writing style'), but once you do, a throroughly engrossing read. Reading classics such as this is illuminating, and almost literally takes you to another world. Enjoy",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Charlotte Bronte's writing is like food for the soul!,"One of the most delicious books I have ever read. Bronte's command of the words she uses to paint a picture are exquisite. My sister and I decided a few years ago to read some of the 'classics' we had overlooked. Jane Eyre was our first selection. We are forever grateful we did not pass through this life without reading it. Oh, what we would have missed!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My all time favorite classic!,"Oh how I love this novel! Jane Eyre is one of those novels that I can read over and over again and get something new out of it every time. I consider it to be one of the most readable classics, one I can just pick up and lose myself in it without even thinking about it. To me, that's a testament to how well it holds up, there aren't too many classics I can say that about because I find so many of them to be rather plodding.This time around, I found myself to be much more emotional about the trials that Jane goes through. I've gone through quite a few emotional events since the last time I read this one, and that undoubtedly affected my reading of many of the situations Jane is in. I openly wept when reading about her treatment during early childhood at Gateshead and later at Lowell School.As we get towards the middle section of the book, and Jane finds such happiness at Thornfield, I was so elated to witness her journey again. Yet, because I knew where it was going, I found myself deliberately slowing down, as if I could prevent more pain for her simply by reading the story so slowly. Of course, this didn't work and I was soon crying along with Jane again as another misfortune befell her. At some point, I just want poor Jane to catch a break!I think the thing that struck me most during this reading was how incredibly frustrated I was with St. John. Normally my frustration in this book is directed towards Mr. Rochester, he seems so fickle at times and difficult to read. Speaking of, I wasn't ever sure...is Rochester his actual name, or is that his estate/title? I think Fairfax is his real surname but I could be wrong. Those Brits always confuse me with this stuff!Anyway, back to St. John. He really is a good man, you can see it oozing from him, but he is so incredibly stubborn I wanted to reach into the pages and just slap him! I get that things were different back when this was written, and that what Jane proposed to him really just wasn't feasible. My frustration stems from his inability to just let the whole thing go!Given that he basically knows the entirety of Jane's story, I think it's really manipulative of him to continually try to convince her to do what he wants. He's not a stupid man, he knows that Jane longs to be involved with other people and is eager to please due to her childhood being so grim. And rather than taking a truly Christian path by wishing her the best when she makes her own choice, he continues to try and guilt her into doing things his way, even to the detriment of her own health, without any real concern for what may be best for her personally. Maybe it's my own ambivalent religious beliefs that make this more difficult for me, because I just don't believe that Jane should have to give up the things she believes may make her happy simply because St. John believes she *could* be a good servant to the lord. Needless to say, I agree with the choices Jane makes in the end, as she was finally able to do as she pleased.Because this is a reread for me, I knew all the major plot points ahead of time, and I think that knowledge added to the frustration I felt for St. John. With each reading, I feel like I understand Jane a little more, and feel for her more deeply, so I can almost experience the pain she goes through to the point that her conversations with these important people really affect me on an intimate level. I felt my own happiness being ripped away at the same time that Jane did, and that makes her all the more real to me.I've lost count of how many times I've read this novel, but this one really cemented it as my all time favorite classic, and one of the books I recommend to people when they ask for something new to read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Janet Eyre,"It was nice to be able to read this classic for free. A very progressive book for its time. The translation, it says, was done by volunteers. That may explain some of the errors, for example, towards the end of the book when they alternated between calling her 'Jane' and 'Janet'",neutral

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An old favorite,"I remember first reading this book when I was in high school. The story of this girl fascinated me. I loved the language and emotion, and the beautiful picture of a life well lived that the author has managed to depict so carefully. As for this edition, there are a few errors, but the narration makes up for it. Even when I first read the book, I was not so completely immersed in the story as I was this time with the narration. I found myself not knowing what happened next, as excited to find out as the first time I'd read it. I have enjoyed every second spent reading and listening to this beautiful story.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A beautiful classic!,"After seeing the movie several times, decided I should read this classic. I'm surprised I never have read it before. It is wonderfully written!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My wife LOVES it...,"I downloaded this for my wife - as she said she used to watch Jane Eyre on British TV, waaaaay back. Though she said it's a bit hard to read, with it being a bit &#34;olde english&#34; (and found herself tapping on many words for their definitions), it was certainly worth re-living Jane and Mr Rochester's love affair.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Some lovely passages in between rather dreary writing.,"I particularly like Miss Bronte's use of words to describe natural scenes. I refer to her descriptions of out door scenes. However I did become bored with her lengthy and imaginary conversations with her admirers which accounts for the low rating.I have seen this book described as an auto biography. That cannot be so. Perhaps the early part was written from her actual experiences but this book was finished long before she was married to the curate, not Rochester.I am beginning to realize that this was in fact the Victorian style of writing.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Things happen in this Victorian era novel...but still not enough.,"Similar in some respects to other Victorian era novels, this one is more exciting than most. Things happen. There is mystery and intreague. Even so, it's difficult at times not to get fed up with the flowery, laborious, self-aware banter that men and women of the day seemed required to engage in. Some of the prose is very clever, and that's always fun to hear. But there are times when you want to just shout: GET TO THE POINT, ALREADY! Nonetheless, there's a few great moments, and it's a fun book.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An excellent book.,"I cannot say what has not been said by earlier reviewers here. My only contribution is that this character is perhaps one of the early examples of a feminist, a working woman (think Eleanor Roosevelt) despite Jane's eventual wealth. Her choices, her voice, her thoughts were well ahead of her time and context. I was really impressed with this story. The writing, shockingly, has held up through the many that have passed since this book was first published.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A beautiful Read - The First Feminist ?,"What a wonderful read.Here is a story of an Amazing Woman.I love reading ""free"" books on my Kindle, and I have read lots of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens.LOL - But I did not like it only because it was FREE. :-)This is a wonderful tale of a courageous woman with a free mind and free spirit. Jane Eyre is the earliest book I have ever read of a truly independent woman who not only has intelligence and courage but also has the will to use them.Even with this aside - the writing sweeps you in and makes you care about the characters in a way that books ought to.Books come in all styles ""heavy"" ""light"" ""suspense""....this is all three. It is a joy to read.",positive

About halfway through the book, it would use Janet instead of Jane- but not all the time. It might say Jane at the beginning of the page, but half-way down, I see Janet. Why is that??Also, it puts quotations where they are not needed.Overall, I loved this book, despite the minor glitches. I've always wanted to read Bronte, and now I have thanks to the Kindle!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre - Penguin Classics edition,"Jane Eyre is probably one of my favorites in classic literature. I have quite a few different editions of it.

In fact, I may need to order another copy just so that I can keep one in my bookcase and the other on my nightstand. I can't praise the Penguin Classics enough.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,An acquired taste,"A strange read. It's hard to like a book when the main character is so odd, infuriatingly placid and unrelatable, along with incomprehensible taste in men. The first nine chapters seemed overall unnecessary in its length and read like a very depressing Anne of Green Gables. And yet I found myself caring about what happens to Jane, so I kept reading. Three stars, as despite the publisher's claim to superiority, there were many typos; especially annoying were the ones around page 175 where Rochester keeps calling her Janet.",neutral

And thrives. And having made a success of her life away from the abuse, she applies for a job as a governess. Her new employer harbors a dark secret that Jane doesn't learn until her wedding day - a secret that threatens to change her life forever.Written in an older world style with &#34;million dollar words,&#34; one can excuse the sometimes awkward writing style n favor of an outstanding story that shines through and tugs at your heart. The reader walks with Jane through her courage, her stubborness, her pain and her victories.

I loved it as much as I ever have but this time I knew what parts were autobiographical and where the basic concept for the story came from. Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well. Still, knowing that the marriage proposal from St. John Rivers has a basis in Charlotte Bronte's life made it more interesting this time around. I highly recommend both books.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane's Way To Success,"The novel I read ""Jane Eyre"" was very interesting. Jane Eyre was a little orphanage girl, that lived with a family she did not love. Jane didn't feel as if that was her home. Jane says, ""I was like nobody there. If they did not love me, in fact, as little as I did them."" There was to main people that had hurt her the most physically and mentally, Master Reed and Mrs. Reed . Master Reed was a cruel young boy. He liked to criticize, make fun of, and hurt Jane. He thought he was the boss and owned everything in the house. In the book it says that Jane was reading a book and he came along and asked, ""Why are you touching my stuff? Everything in here will belong to me one day."" She responded, ""I'm only reading a book."" He made her look away and threw the book to her head. Master Reed didn't get in trouble at all, because he was Mrs. Reed precious son.Another thing that interested me is that she was a girl that wanted to be different. No matter how people looked down at her, or ridiculed her, she was always determined to be someone in life. Mrs. Reed was very cruel to Jane because she was trying every way possible to put her in school or send her away. Jane began to think that she wasn't good enough for that family. They had downgraded her so much, that Jane began to think bad about herself. Jane began to think to herself, "" What thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? She wanted someone to care about her and show her love. This novel would be good for a person looking for motivation or a book that is very inspiring. I recommend this book because it is a very detailed and is a very heartwarming book.",positive

She listens to her instincts, and let them guide her through the course of her life, not matter what the perceived cost may be.I found this story compelling. Even though the subject matter wasn't gripping or exhilarating, the manner in which it was written was enough to keep me interested every page of the way.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,"Full of gothic angst, this can be a frustrating read.","JANE EYREBront, Charlotte. Jane Eyre. New York: Penguin Books, 1996 (reprint edition). Genre: Classic Victorian literature; gothic romance and suspense. Age range: Middle school to adult.It is sad that only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the noonday sun. Clearly, the sun rarely shown at Haworth Grange, or anywhere near the wind-blown Yorkshire Dales--it might have reversed the unfortunate Bronts' madness. Page for page of gothic drama and angst, Jane Eyre can be a frustrating read. Jane's insecurity, low self-esteem, and then dramatic personality change near the end of the (very long) story hardly seem worth the agony for the dubious benefit of the love of Mr. Rochester. Those Bronts were all mad as hatters, and the unfortunate Mrs. Rochester wasn't the only one who should have been kept under lock and key. Be that as it may, the Bronts wrote classic British literature in the early Victorian Age, and therefore should be read, if only to see where gothic romance has come since then (not too far, unless you include &quot;Rebecca,&quot; by Daphne DuMaurier, a far tighter story, with as much spinelessness in the heroine, but at a far faster pace), and to understand that women did not have much else to write about in those days--thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,Choose a different version of this classic,"This book misrepresents itself. We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety.

Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the ""Peek inside"" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item.

Needless to say, I never finished it. Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture ""if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off.

Everyone has gone into the gist of the tale but I will tell you what I find most facinating.Charlotte Bronte wrote this in the first half of the 1800's. It's amazing that a woman in that century would be so bold & outspoken. Not only is Charlotte of this character but so is our heroine, Jane Eyre. In the year 2012 not many would find her personality unique but when reading consider that age in which this was written. A tad slow but that can be overlooked when getting to know Jane's character & wit. It's never too late for a classic - go ahead and take a chance.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Okay In My Opinion,"It was hard for me to love this book because I had trouble relating to Jane Eyre. She was a well rounded character...and every page of her story was vivid and interesting...but I just never really adored her as a character.She is not weak...she's more gentle...strong in character...but gentle...delicate and fierce in character. It's a bit hard to explain...but that's the reason I found it hard to relate.It was also tough because she at 18 yrs is so much like a girl and she falls in love with a man. It's well written...believable and I guess romantic...but it's hard to think of it that way because I never felt for Jane or Mr. Rochester or even some of the background characters enough to be enthralled by their stories.I did like little Adele though (partly because she was French and partly because she always spoke her mind. The author did a great job making her sound like a real kid.So I suggest you try this book, but I'll admit it wasn't my favorite.",neutral

She met each obstacle in her life as a student and governess with courage and spirit. As a governess, she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester, who had a terrible secret from his past; however, their bond was so strong that it overcame even this obstacle.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,this is what a romance should be...,"Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the ""syrupy-ness"" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Suffered, Struggled, and Overcame","With an unexciting introduction of Jane's abusive childhood, Jane Eyre later develops into a dramatic struggle in search of autonomy and love. The story constantly shifts between poignant moments in Jane's life and triumphant ones. Like a typical classic, the novel starts with an abusive childhood and ends with a happy marriage. As mundane as it may sound, the story is unique and the reader grows to respect Jane for the hard choices she makes.Jane struggles to choose between her passionate love story and desire for independence, asserting that satisfaction results from a balance between emotions and desire. Jane develops from a miserable and mistreated child, to a well-respected and independent woman after she learns to discern between passion and reason.Jane decides to flee Thronfield and escape from the luxurious style of life to find her identity. She sacrifices her true love for Rochester and prefers starvation in order to flee from passions and desires. Yielding to her emotions would cause Jane to be a prisoner in her own eyes.Jane's social status does not compare to Rochester's wealthy possessions. When Jane, however, becomes rich, from an unexpected heritage, she willingly returns to Rochester, after having balanced between morals and passions.When Jane finally leads a comfortable life, she refuses to yield to reason, choosing love instead. Jane refuses St. John's proposal because she finds it necessary for her to choose love and happiness over the ideal woman society expects of her. Jane once again leaves her previous comfortable life in search for her true love. Even with Rochester's physical and social deteriorating conditions, she is able to find true love because she balances between desires and expectations. Jane's sense of freedom is to not yield to the position she is in if her conscience and desires are not both satisfied.Adding to its thrills, the Gothic character of Bertha Mason portrays the dark romanticism movement of the era in the late 19th century. Setting the house on fire, and tearing Jane's bridal gown on her wedding night, she is the conflict that tears Jane and Rochester apart. She also causes Rochester's blindness and loss of his house. She is killed in the fire and Jane, much stronger now, is back to compensate Rochester for all what he has suffered.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre: A Refreshing Love Story,"Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Beware: The review reveals some of the plot!,"Jane Eyre, written in 1946 by Charlotte Bront, tells the story of an orphan girl who struggles to overcome the hardships that threaten her relationship with Mr. Rochester. After leaving her hateful aunt and cousins, and then her school, Lowood, Jane Eyre travels to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is here that she encounters Mr. Rochester, and the two fall in love. However, the novel is full of surprises and their love does not go untested.The chapters describing Jane's time at Gateshead and Lowood bring to mind characters such as Matilda and Harry Potter. As familiar as it is, the story is still heart-warming and builds up the reader's feelings for Jane for the rest of the novel. At Thornfield Hall, it is obvious that Jane is falling in love with Mr. Rochester. It is less clear that Mr. Rochester has feelings for Jane. After waiting out the suspense, the reader is finally rewarded with Mr. Rochester's proposal to Jane. Jane herself is not excited, and I found myself wishing that she was happier. Even though Charlotte Bronte's foreshadowing hints that something is not right at Thornfield, the horrific revelation of Mr. Rochester's deranged and murderous wife is a twist that surprised me. I was irritated with Jane for her choice of reason and pride over true love, but eager to find out what becomes of her.For one chapter, Jane wanders through villages in Yorkshire, desperate to find work, food, and shelter. I was angry with her for forgetting her parcel on the carriage, and I just wanted her to return to Thornfield Hall. Reluctantly, Jane reasons that returning to Mr. Rochester goes against her pride and sense and she refuses to go back. Eventually, she encounters the Rivers, who provide a place for her to stay. Simultaneously, Jane discovers that she has inherited a fortune and the Rivers are her cousins. Jane is far more overjoyed because she has a family rather than that she is rich.St. John Rivers trying to persuade Jane to marry him is the only really low point in Jane Eyre. These chapters are full of long conversations in which Jane agrees to go with him to India but not become his wife, followed by St. John saying that she must marry him. The same points are debated between the two many times, making this part of the book slow and boring. Finally, Jane leaves the Rivers and returns to Thornfield. I was disappointed that Jane didn't put her foot down immediately because it is obvious she will never marry St. John.Jane does suffer many hardships throughout the book, but Bronte rewards her with a happy ending. I liked the fact that Charlotte Bront wrote the prologue so that it took place ten years later. The reader finds out what happened to most of the characters in the book, including St. John, the Rivers sisters, and Ad&egrave;le. I like books that finish completely, with every loose end tied up, and Bront certainly does this in Jane Eyre. This novel is not a simple love story: it is filled with hardships, gothic elements, and mystery.",positive

The school is run so poorly, many of the students die from meager provisions and disease. Jane survives the hardships of being at school; she would rather be anywhere than her aunt and cousins. She stays until the beginning of her adulthood, where she obtains a job as a governess to a child within the moors of England, namely Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall is owned by Edward Rochester, whose satirical character meets Jane's sharp wittiness, creating an intense bond between the two.Bronte intrigues the reader with the intricate development of the characters, making them truly realistic. For example, the choices she has Jane makes choice that are never straightforwardly done. As she goes through a great deal of obstacles, the author has Jane dwell on them in a heart-wrenching and analytical manner. The characters are also realistic to the Victorian time period in which it is set in. The roles of women and men are clearly distinct to the 1800's. It critically explains the patriarchal domination that she's constantly up against with the men in her life (Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rivers) and England's social hierarchy while in her discovery of the complicated social position of governesses.****SPOILER ALERT****The author also explores a couple themes make the book quite interesting to its readers. One is the concept of morality. Jane decides whether her commitment to her philosophies is strong enough to resist the appeals of Mr. Rochester and refuses to be Rochester's mistress because of her ""impassioned self-respect and moral conviction."" She rejects St. John Rivers' marriage proposal because they were not in love and forgives her Aunt Reed despite the cruelty she had Jane endure. Another was religion, when Jane attempts to gain a balance between happiness and faith. She encounters three extreme aspects of Christianity - Mr. Brocklehurst's strict religious discipline, Helen Burns' submissiveness, and St. John Rivers' commitment to charity and accomplishes stability between the three to help control her passionate personality but not completely changing her true self altogether.*****SPOILER ENDS*****Honestly, from the title and cover of the book, you would think it would be an uninteresting biography. However, Charlotte Bronte's story of Jane Eyre has a great deal of twists and turn of events and constantly keeps the reader interested. The book has it all - a blend of passion, romance, mystery, drama and suspense. I believe this to be one of the everlasting classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Just one word - Superb!,"This is one of the best readings of this book I've heard - and I've heard (and read) the book many times. I strongly recommend this for fans - especially if you're looking for a CD to listen to during a trip, when you can hear most or all of it at once.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,"A little difficult, but ok","I know it's written in an older more elegant style, but I found it a little difficult to follow at times. However, I still found it interesting it just took me some time to get through it. Frankly I had to stop reading it at certain times and read another book for a chapter or two",neutral

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,Even better than when read it thirty. Years ago in high school. Can't wait to watch the movie again. Wonderful,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Decent and heartfelt book,I think the reason this book is such a great read is the fact that Jane is an amazing and quite easily remarkable character. I chose this novel as an independent reading in my lit class this year and feel that it was a great choice. The book speaks to readers and makes you feel as if you are actually in the story.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The movie made me want to read the book,This has got to be my favorite book of all times. Jane Eyre suffered and she remained strong and determained. She was in love with this man who found her purity and loyality to be everything.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Witty and Inspiring,"The most favorable aspect of Bronte's Jane Eyre is her humor. There is so much wit hiding in the undertones of Jane's astute observations and conversations. To me this is a fantastic read which I come back to of and over again, for the love story, the humor, and the inspiration Bronte provides in the character of Jane Eyre. She is strong and witty and independent, yet kind and good and humble. This is a rival for one of my favorite books of all time.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,A great classic . . . written in a style no longer seen. Great reading for the genre . . . descriptive and romantic.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic,"Of all classic female authors (Jane Austin, Mary Shelly, for instance), and of all classic novels with a female protagonist, I find Charlotte Bronte as the most brilliant, and Jane Eyre to be the most memorable. I first read this book when i was a freshman in highschool, and loved it. Now I'm reading it as an upcoming college freshman. I not only still love it as I did then, but I'm deeply moved. I'm touched by how I personally connect with Jane Eyre, who not only has the wit, intelligence, honesty, and flourishing independence that constitutes the spirit of many female characters, like that from Jane Austin, but who stands the test of time as more than just a witty, intelligent female. Jane Eyre is a woman, a woman that all can relate to. Also, I love how the novel itself was written. Charlotte Bronte weaves in all the elements of a good story--suspense, passion, mystery, gothicism-- while entwining emotions like love, hate, death, regret, sadness, rebirth, and forgiveness. This is more than just a gothic novel, more than just a novel with a statement about Victorian society. It's a novel with heart, courage, and a journey that never ends in the heart, mind, and spirit. This is what real literature is all about.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be,"Don't get me wrong, I love nineteenth century British literature as much as anyone. This book, however, is mediocre at best. The symbolism is blatant and contrived to the point of being distracting. In fact, the whole story is extremely contrived, even for a romance. Neither are Charlotte's characters endearing enough to make the novel worthwhile. Jane, Rochester, and Adele are all a bit annoying rather than charming or good or even evil. And I have no idea why this novel would be considered Gothic, the only thing that qualifies that idea is all the ridiculous magic that's going on. Actually, the second half of the novel reads more like an Austen husband hunt with a little bit of weirdness thrown in.The Lowood section is redeeming, however. The description smacks of Dickens, chiding the English for their treatment of the helpless. The characters of the Brocklehursts are beautifully rendered hypocrites.Emily's Wuthering Heights is by far the better read if you're after a Bronte. All of her characters have depth so that even the villains become loved. Wuthering Heights is also fairly contrived and full of obvious symbolism, but unlike Jane Eyre, the mechanics of the story add to it rather than distracting from it. Above all, the pathos and darkness are delightful, especially coming from a nineteenth century British woman. Charlotte herself wrote in the preface to WH that she didn't understand why Emily had to write something so dark. My opinion is that Charlotte could have used a little bit of that darkness herself. Read WH if you want something really complex to savor; JE just makes a good beach read.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Masterpiece definition of proper respect,"It seems to me Bronte's schooling of her own mind rather than the schooling depicted in the book (which are the same thing) depend more or less likely on your inclination to the subject of respect.The willingness to let go all sanity and resume mental thought at a moment's whim is the virtue displayed here.Like most books of this type, not much thought is given to plot or to the romance of being in a plot as much as to the figures at play here, right and wrong, moral and honest, truth and lie-sayer. I would probably say this is the best way for a young girl to grow up, having written a work like this. This is more a study in her life than in the life of a person blessed with any gifts. Growing up modest has taught her something: that she made modesty.The gift of the unique insight of creation in each and every line is apparent and is a unique challenge to the reader to contemplate the meaning of suffering she has placed into every line.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Avowal,"The story of Jane Eyre told by any other author would be a tale told to elicit tears, or sometimes a smile. As it is the book is so sincere and frank it seems to weep in your hands, and requires no acknowledgment from you. Indeed, Jane Eyre is very likely above such avowal even were you to tender it. To me this otherwise magnificent piece served as a reminder of my dispassion, indolence, insincerity, and how hot it will be when I'm eternally burning in hell.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,pretty good,"I'm reading this novel for my AP English class, and it's okay so far (I'm about 50 pages short of finishing the book). Bronte definitely has a way with words, and Jane's story, though in some parts a bit unrealistic, certainly makes for a good read. However, the dialogue is a little confusing sometimes because the author uses the wrong pronouns (like: &quot;Would she like a morsel of bread?&quot; when it ought to be &quot;Would YOU like a morsel of bread?&quot;)This happens pretty often near the end, and it's terribly annoying. These flaws not withstanding, however, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; will appeal to anyone who enjoys the romance and soap-opera plots of Victorian literature paired with some gothic characteristics (crazy Bertha screaming and doing mischief in her locked cell).",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Love, Lies, Mystery, and Maybe Happy Ever After","As many people may know, ""Jane Eyre"" is the story of an orphaned girl who has an evil aunt that locks her away in an eerie red room where her uncle died in. Being the protagonist of the novel, Jane breaks away from her aunt's oppression and stands up for herself. As Jane lives life away from her aunt, she realizes that the outside world is just as strenuous. Against many odds, Jane pushes forward with her life. She finds a job as a governess and falls in love with her employer and he loves her back, but of course with Jane's luck, more obstacles are hurdled at her.Being set during the Victorian period, social status already plays a big obstacle in Jane's life. When obstacles, though some highly unlikely, beyond social class prevent her from marrying the love her life, Jane must establish her own code of ethics. What is wrong and what is right? What can she do and what can she not do?The novel may seem to focus much on the aspect of Jane's love life, but there's much more to it than that. Throughout Jane's love story, there's always eerie things going on, for example the shrieking yell coming from a room no one is allowed in and that's just the beginning. ""Jane Eyre"" is a book that has many different aspects and a hint of gothic fiction. There's love, mystery, strength, courage, and faith. It's the journey of a lost female on the road of identifying herself. This is a classic that should not be passed up especially if you're a person who believes that love prevails against all odds. This classic is a refreshing book to read; it's not every day that you find such a strong female character in literature.Even though the only complain I have to offer is the lengthiness and the endless dialogue, this novel is worth it all. Read along with Jane's story as she discovers what she has to offer the world and herself. The story will have you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. The main question, however, will Jane get her happy ending?",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Great book!,This book is really good. It is one of my favorites. I read it as a teen and wanted to reread it as an adult. The Kindle app is amazing. I downloaded Jane Eyre for free and am now able to enjoy it on my Ipad and my pc whenever I want to take a little walk down memory lane.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,mixed feelings...,"I read Jane Eyre in high school and recently decided to pick it up again. It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some ""coincidences"" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,$0.89 Kindle Edition,"I'm going to rate the quality of the Kindle Edition since this seems to be the only place to do so. I won't go into the story since there's a perfectly good sysnopsis on the description page and several well written reivews on the work itself. The kindle edition was good to say the least. I did find a few spelling errors that were annoying, but none more so than the heroine, Jane, repeatedly being referred to as 'Janet' throughout the entire novel; I find this to be unacceptable. I do not know if this occurs in the print-versions as this was my first encounter with the story. Had there been less (or no) spelling errors as well as the correct name reference to the main character, I would have given it 5 stars on content alone---although it still creeps me out that 19 year olds and 40 year olds so frequently ended up marrying in that day and age, but I just had to put it out of my mind when reading. Otherwise it was a good read and I look forward to reading more works by the Bronte sisters.",neutral

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Beautiful empowering story,"I never read this growing up and I had no real idea what it was about but just as you grow up and hear about Romeo and Juliet or other things that people around you refer to at times, I had heard of Jane Eyre in passing. I always wanted to go ahead and read some literature and some classics but didn't know where to start so out of the blue I saw a message in email one day that Jane Eyre was free so I downloaded it and began to skim through it. I ended up reading it right away and devouring it. I absolutely loved this story and the writing was so beautiful and thought provoking and I immediately thought to myself &#34;THIS is what a writer should 'sound' like&#34;. I want my daughter to read it because I take away from the story that it is okay to be yourself, to be humble but proud of being who you are. To be true to yourself and be strong and though difficulties come your way, you can and will get through them. I wish I had read it when younger and had made it a part of my references as I grew and to have it to fall back on in my mind but I didn't but I am sure glad I have finally read it and now I look forward to also watching a movie about it that I found :).

It's incredible what a gifted writer can produce, i.e. a fictional character who'd come to be more &quot;real&quot; to you than actual people in your lives, and far more unforgettable. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not just for females - I exhort all males to jump in and lose yourself in this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,I was not particularly pleased.,"Though I did enjoy Jane Eyre, I found that the author, in my opinion, sometimes took an extremely long time to get through something. At one point, the author actually says 'I need but a few lines to expain the next 5 years of my life' or something to the effect of that, and she take at least 3 pages doing it. I don't have the largest attention span, and sometimes Jane Eyre just took too long for me to keep going.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Pretty Good,"Although it's not as good as Wuthering Heights, the story of Jane and Rochester is a good one. Jane, after having an uphappy childhood, deserves the love and happiness she feels with Rochester. The ending was a bit of a suprise.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Disagree with author, but still a good book","The main theme of Jane Eyre is that happiness and contentment can be found during our lives on earth. This is shown in the fact that Jane led a very discontented and sad childhood, but she found happiness in her relationship with Mr. Rochester. This theme also came out very strongly through Jane's cousin John. He was so dedicated to serving God and being a missionary that he asked Jane to marry him because he thought she was a hard worker. He didn't love her, but he believed that serving God came before his own happiness. The book makes it seem as though this is wrong, because in the end John goes to India by himself and does not enjoy the rest of his life. It is presented as though Jane did the fulfilling and satisfying thing by marrying Mr. Rochester, and John did the good but unhappy thing by becoming a missionary in India. Obviously, it is not good to marry someone that you don't love, but Charlotte Bronte seems to take this to the extreme by saying that unless you get married to the person you love, you will not lead a satisfied life. In truth, if you lead a life dedicated to serving and praising God, you will have a satisfied life. It is not just people and circumstances that can make us happy, but a close relationship with God. Nevertheless, I thought that Jane Eyre was a very good book. There was always a little hint of mystery to keep the reader interested, and the book presented some interesting ideas to think about. Jane Eyre did a good job of presenting Charlotte Bronte's ideas, and it is a very well-written, descriptive book.",positive

She looks to the future and begins to overcome the unhappiness that has plagued her all her life, but Rochester's shady past comes back and brings everything down again.But unlike in the author's sister Emily's Wuthering Heights, this sadness neither dominates nor concludes the book when all is resolved in a happy, if somewhat bittersweet, ending.The real brilliance of Jane Eyre lies in the characters - we can all see ourselves, or our aspirations, reflected in Jane, who overcomes her circumstances to find happiness.",positive

Also, the romantic aspect was wonderful. The plot was quite simple, but yet, beautifully written all at the same time.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Mesmerizing Read,"I had wanted to read Jane Eyre since I was a little girl because, for some strange reason, I was always drawn to the novel. It took eight years for me to finally get around to doing so (I'm 18 now) and my God, I could not be more pleased. Bronte's story is phenomenal! While some may say that the story is nothing original, it should be remembered that this was published in 1847, so it is everything that followed it that is unoriginal. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, but I must say one thing: The novel excellently explores numerous themes, but the one that particularly stood out to me upon reading it is the inability to ever truly love someone else and to stand side-by-side with them before learning to love oneself. Following Jane, our beloved heroine, as she journeyed down this long and winding road, was wonderful for me. I felt that I too grew in some ways and what more could one want from a novel?",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Exciting Gothic story,"When it was first published, people lauded its creation, but after discovering that Currer Bell was actually a woman, Charlotte Bronte, they were horrified with the passion with which she wrote. Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. ""Jane Eyre"" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story.

I reread it 4-5 times, and finally read the unabridged version when I got to high school and have reread it about 3 times since. Jane Eyre never ceases to amaze and delight me. Having first read the book at such a young and impressionable age, I think Jane Eyre has always been my inspiration. Her courage and spunk are qualities that as a little girl, I most deeply admired and wanted to emulate. It is a wonderful book for young women to read to for its strong willed heroine who nonetheless exhibits all of the compassion and femininity that women must also possess. So much what we teach young women today is, be masculine and ruthless to get ahead in this world. Women should be proud and not afraid to be feminine. That is a power that we possess that men don't.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Disliking a classic novel,"Ladies and gentlemen, readers of all ages, I express my sheer condolences if I offend anyone from what I am about to write: The novel Jane Eyre, I thought, was boring to the extent that I would often drift asleep while reading it. Although I am not use to a story that does not go straight to the conflict, I believe this story was on going. There is some excellent imagery, and metaphorical aspects in the story, but only that can not save this narrative. If you are a person that loves a romantic setting with certain twists every now and then, this is the book for you.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Not a book for the average male!,"While there are wonderful characters and a somewhat clever plot, this book gets very boring! The main thrill of the novel is just a written account of most girls' dream of becoming the wife of a man to whom they are truly in love (OK, so Jane had some hardships along the way too...;-)). Of course, Jane is very independent and has no exceptionally good looks, so the story may be considered an inspiration to the female culture's wish of being respected for what is inside...? I found it an inspiration to go to bed a little sooner.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Sign of a good book: number of cracks in the binding,"Just imagine. You're reading along, you come to a place in the bok that captures your attention. You're completely engulfed by the story, you're not reading it, you're living it! The &quot;real&quot; world is gone. You hear neither phone nor voice. You feel neither hunger nor thirst. You feel only what the author's pen tells you to feel. You are eager to read on. Your eyes cannot read the enthralling story fast enough. In your frenzied haste to know more, you grip the book tighter and bend it back, cracking the binding.Years later when you pick the very same book up again, you can tell the scary, happy, or sad parts of the book by the location of the creases. Jane Eyre is such a book. It is one of three or four books who contentend for the multiple-crack champion.I was assigned to read this book for an AP English class. Although I love to read, class-assigned books had a dubious history with me. Most, I felt, were boring or too pessimistic to find favor with me. I had heard many people talk about the book favorably after having read it in middle school. I put my hope in their past experiences and began to read. Although the first pages did not entirely confirm the praises the book had recieved, the book so far surrpassed my expectations that I finished the book in only a few days time! I would have read non-stop if it had been within my means to do so. When I did get the chance to read, I read as much as I could to the exclusion of food and family sometimes!You may be wondering what about this book could make me such a fanatic. Well, I could give you deep literary criticism about the symbolism, the metaphors, or the imagery, but that doesn't really help you enjoy the story more, it only rounds out the meaning. Instead, let me tell you why you want to read this book.This book combines passion and logic. An odd combination that don't often go together. Jane Eyre starts out in life full of passion and emotions, through torture and schooling, she learns to control her feelings and be ruled by logic. As she moves through life she struggles to find a balance between what her emotions tell her and what logic demands. Logic helps her through times when she feels abandoned and emotions guide her back to love when the tables are turned.This book skillfully combines elements from nearly all genre and is sure to please anyone. It has action, romance, comedy, suspence, even the supernatural! This book is sure to put cracks in YOUR binding",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"A good classic, but I've seen better","---In Charlotte Bronte's classic JANE EYRE, the title character is a strong willed woman who undergoes many hardships and trials, but eventually comes out triumphant. This book is a mixed one for me. I appriciate the classic nature of this story, and I like the heroine, but there is just a self righteous tone to the entire book. ---- Jane Eyre was raised by her terrible and cruel aunt who cares not a wick for her. This was possibly her earliest hardship, yet she persevered the tough childhood years, and becomes even stronger when her aunt puts her in a terrible boarding school. Eventually, she takes a position as a nanny in the house of a rich man where she finds what it is to be loved.------ The problem I had with this story was the &quot;love&quot; between the rich man and Jane Eyre.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Bad edition of a great novel,"Jane Eyre is by far one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is interesting and is written in a beautiful fashion. However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,really thought provoking,"This novel is one of the most expressionistic novels I have ever read. It clearly conveys the love between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester as Jane Eyre emerges into womanhood. It is about life strengthening situations and finding a love that clearly does not look at the physical, but a true love that is deep within the heart. Jane Eyre is a great book by Charlotte Bronte and I will treasuer it where I go, and reread and reread it over and over. It's spectacular.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,All of Jane Eyre is worth reading,"I will probably read this book again. I borrowed it from a friend and will most likely get my own copy. I liked Jane Eyre as a main character better than Catherine from Wuthering Heights because Jane was more compassionate. I also liked her because of her intriguing personality. From the beginning she sets herself as different from other people, more hardy and thoughtful. Her stay at Lowood is interesting, mainly because of her relationship with Helen and the contrast between the two. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is original. Some of that is due to the fact that Jane falls in love without being made foolish by it. Her stay with the Rivers family was sort of frustrating, because her character was suppressed by St. John. I really didn't like him. The ending was very good except for the last few paragraphs which dwell on St. John. But, that aside, Jane Eyre is a wonderful book, deserving to be read and reread by everyone.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Visit another time when shock value had no value.,"As a child of the eighties, when reading recently published books and seeing movies, I've grown accustomed to &quot;love&quot; being graphically depicted sexual attraction that eventually turns into romance. How refreshing it is to read Jane Eyre, where the order is reversed! A portrayal of love like this is hard to come by. In Jane Eyre, everything is pure, and the love is passionate without anything you'd be embarrassed to tell your parents about. The characters are likeable - I found myself rooting for the protagonsits, hoping Jane and Mr. Rochester would wind up togther no matter how many obstacles they may come across. Yeah, there are a lot of descriptions, but surprisingly, there was even a little adventure. I enjoyed it!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A suberb novel about understanding human love and endurance,"I've noticed a trend in those readers who have disliked this novel; they seem to have been forced to read Jane Eyre. I too read this book for school, but began about six months before it was due. I think it is truly one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, with strong messages about human behavior..Jane, despite difficult beginnings in her life, became the strongest, most loving charcter in the book. Who really cares that she fell in love with an &quot;old guy?&quot; Here's a newsflash..he was only in his thirties or forties, and that isn't so old. Jane found love, and that's a bigger accomplishment than a lot of us can claim. Try Jane Eyre again some other time if you're up against a deadline..details are not evil, description is not boring. If the rest of the world says Jane Eyre is a classic, although you are entitled to your own opinion, there's a good chance it is. And one more thing-&quot;renting the movie&quot; and buying &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; are not alternative options to reading a novel. To think that taking shortcuts in reading for school assignments is an advantage, is to fool yourself. I had a teacher give a pass/fail test in which the true/false questions relied solely upon the differences between a book and the movie made after it. Something to think about.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre was a milestone for English as we know it,"A WOMEN'S MASTREPIECE&quot;Dear Reader&quot;- Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre was a milestone for English Literature as we know it. The fact that this captivating novel was written by a 19th century women only enhances it's genius. Charlotte Bronte acted as a trailblazer for all the women authors that would follow her; her unique style of writting and the essence of her characters stimulates the interests of every individual who reads even one line. Jane Eyre is a romantic novel about an innocent girl's voyage through life. The main character,Jane, is a orphan who we are introduced to as she is living in a house full of cruelty. The home belongs to a sour, cold women called Mrs. Reed and her three aggressive children. &quot;He bullied me and punished me ; not two or three times a week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually : every nerve I had feared hom, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.&quot; Mrs. Reed's son John's treatment of jane caused harsh and long-lasting effects. The family's unjustifiable hatred for Jane results in her being sent to a distant school. Lowood is a cold, and gloomy institution for girls. Its routines are militay, its teachings are restrictive, and its conditions are horrible. She attends this school for eight years during which she excels in her studies as well as in sense. Despite the unsettled environment of Lowood, Jane enjoys her time spent there and more importantly cherishes the friendships made there. This is the place where Jane meets her first true friend Helen Burns. It is through helen's example that jane learns to be patient, diligent and expressive. &quot;Her (Helen) soul sat on her lips and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.&quot; After eight years, Jane desires to move on in life. jane is now educated, confident and ready for change. After advertising for a teaching position, Jane accepts an offer to be a governess at Thornfield. Thornfield is a grand, old estate surrounded by the lonely moors of England. Her motive for going to Thornfield is to instruct the vibrant, young pupil Adele. The immense events and heart wrenching romance that she encounters there change her intentions quite dramatically. Jane's relationship wiht the dark and tortured owner of Thornfield, Mr. Rochester, forms the foundation of Jane's womanhood. The most unique aspect of this romance is the heroine's response to love. the majority of romance novels present a similar picture of love's hold on womane. they become increasingly more like the men they love and less like themselves. they grow weaker, more compliant and vulnerable. However, this novel's heroine does not conform but rather defies the expected. Jane discovers her love for another through the discovery of the love for herself. &quot;Women feel just as men feel.&quot; It would be pure arrogance and a literary sin if I were to describe what happens within the hidden walls of Thornfield. For this novel's majety lies not only within it's story but in the actual words of Charlotte Bronte. The way she can so vividly depict a scene or how she so clearly desribes love is a wonder. &quot;I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspects, and life in its colour: and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the front of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.&quot; Charlotte Bronte had the gift of being able to capture emotion and reflect it on paper; making the image more enticing than the subject. i strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a hunger for passion, a thirst for excitement and a desire for intellect. You are not only given complete enjoyment from this novel, but a life lesson as well. This lesson implies that the only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself and to what you love. This is a lesson that you can carry with you on your own journey through life, as Jane Eyre did.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,"Liked it, but didn't love it.","I was at first really absorbed in reading the parts that had to do with Jane's childhood. I did not miss a word of it. However, I found the parts after she became a governess a bit boring. I had a hard time with her falling head over heels with Mr. Rochester. He is too cold and self absorbed. Not the chivalrous hero of most fairy tales. His personality doesnt change one iota despite all of the things he has been through. I never ever see a resolve where he loves and accepts Adele. I thought that his indifference toward Adele was one of the things that TURNED JANE OFF about him!! Then she goes weak in the knees over him. I just found that really hard to digest. Yes, I know it's just a fiction, but the inconsistency of the woman who *seemed* to be consistent in her character threw me off.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A brief synopsis and opinions,"This story line opens up with a young orphan girl, Jane Eyre, being abused by her aunt, Sarah Reed, who is to take care of her now that her parents are dead. It is arranged for Jane to be sent to Lowood School, a boarding school fifty miles away. At Lowood, the food is scarce, living conditions are poor, and they have no coats or mittens to keep them warm. Typhus plagues the school, killing Jane's only true friend, Helen. Jane's academics thrive, and after six years she takes the place of a teacher. Two years later Jane places an ad in the Herald, which is answered by a single letter. Jane travels 16 miles to find that she is the new teacher to Edward Rochester's foster child. By the second month she is there, Jane comes to be quite fond of her pupil, Adele Varens, and she is beginning to be aware of how she cares for Mr. Rochester. As she spends more time at Thornfield, Jane's affection for Rochester deepens, as he pursues Blanche Ingram. Jane leaves Thornfield shortly to visit Mrs. Reed, her dying aunt. Mrs. Reed confesses that John Eyre, Jane's uncle has been trying to locate her, but Mrs. Reed discouraged him. She then dies, unloved by even her daughters. Jane returns to Thornfield and is immediately proposed to by Rochester. During their wedding ceremony, Mr. Briggs stands up and proclaims that Mr. Rochester is already married. Jane is then shown to the third floor of Thornfield, where Bertha Mason Rochester, Rochester's wife is locked away. Jane flees Thornfield and uses all her money for transportation. She finds herself reduced to begging and is invited into the home of St. John Rivers, a minister. She recuperates from the trauma in her life under the care of him and his two sisters Mary and Diana. Jane accepts a job as a teacher in a local school. She soon discovers that John Eyre has left her with 20,000 pounds, which she openly shares with St. John and his sisters. St. John proposes to her but Jane repeatedly refuses; she does not love him. In turning down St. John she realizes she is still in love with Rochester. She gets news that Bertha Rochester jumped off the roof and killed herself during a fire that blinded her husband. Jane heads to Ferndean, Rochesters present home, and they reunite and plan to marry. The next time we hear from Jane again is ten years later. Rochester has regained sight in one eye and they have a newborn son. This book ends on a happy note with Jane telling us how contented she is with her present life.I found this book to be extremely thought- provoking. We see the trials and tribulations of a young girl who goes through so many hardships yet comes out a better person each time. I gave this book a five star rating because it expressed the life of a truly amazing young woman in a truly amazing way.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Charlotte Bronte's Great Romance,"Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is as a great romance and a clever book. It is marked by an intelligent pessimism as opposed to a silly optimism which is also a marked point in most of Thomas Hardy's work. You go through the psychological struggles of Jane Eyre, an orphan first with the oppressive regime at the Lowood School and later with her employer Mr. Rochester and her cousin St.John Rivers. It is strong in the depiction of the environment in which the novel takes place and it also succeeds in making an argument about colonialism and psychology. Strongly recommended.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,don't think of it as a text book,"I put off reading this book for years - it was sitting on the dusty shelf in my schoolroom, by the Austens, Dickens and Shakespeare and looked like the driest book in the world. However, like those other books, Jane Eyre has stood the test of time, and there's a good reason for that. So 10 years after I left school I finally went ahead and read it, and was delighted to find that it is one of the best written and romantic stories you will ever read. Jane is orphaned at an early age, has a sad and lonely childhood, finds a job and a chance at romance, only to have it all dashed away and she is apparently left destitute....but it's not over yet.

I can understand how you would not like this book if you don't like cheesy love stories (and, trust me, the ending is VERY cheesy) but it's just a wonderful book in all. The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love. The only thing that gets me is the age difference between Rochester and Jane but I don't stress over it. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good romantic pick-me-up.",positive

She is also quiet, meek (in her own way), but has strong opinions in the book. Mr. Rochester is dark, miserable, and extremly moody. I disliked Adele because she is way too irritating and spoiled. Miss Ingram is just as spoiled as Adele, intolerant, shallow, and insensitive. I don't really understand why Jane did not really investigate the strange laughter and Grace Poole. Well, she did but it was a very light interogation. She took Mrs. Fairfax's word for everything. Some of the things she said would be worth checking out. It gives more mystery to the book.",positive

At the beginning of the book we start off with the hardships of her childhood.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre: An Excellent Book,"Kathleen MarcotteMiss Wilson's 8th period English classDeath, deception, love, pain and you're not even halfway through the book. The book Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a strong woman named Jane and her growth from a rejected orphan to a strong and independent woman. After living like a servant in her cruel aunt's home, Jane is sent off to receive an education at a poor institute for orphans. After witnessing the death of her best friend and surviving six more years there, Jane becomes a teacher and eventually a governess at the Thornfield Manor under the master, Edward Rochester.Unlike many stories about love, in this one it is Jane's intellect and passion that is what attracts Edward Rochester. They fall deeply in love, but the discovery of Edward's insane wife causes Jane to run away. Charlotte Bronte uses her talent with words to vividly describe Jane's pain.""Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent expectant woman---almost a bride---was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow...My hopes were all dead---struck with a subtle doom"" (314).Homeless, penniless, and near death Jane somehow finds work and a place to stay. Her path of self-discovery continues in the finding of her cousins and her inheritance of her uncle's fortune.She finally returns to Edward to find him staying with his servants. The once wealthy businessman had become wifeless, homeless, blind, and crippled from a fire. Jane and Edward's love had not diluted in their time apart but grew stronger. The story ends happily with Jane and Edward's marriage and birth of a son.This book is written with such detail and emotion, you instantly connect with the young woman. The depth and compassion of this book draws the reader in and teaches him/her about determination and self-worth. Her morality and strength, in a time when women were not accepted for their minds, makes Jane stand out from other heroines. When she is at the point of near death from hunger and fatigue, she will not give up.""While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do other wise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and the sense of desolation-this total prostration of hope...And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! Sustain me a little longer!"" (351).Jane Eyre is a classic book, but the text is quite long and at times can seem to trail off. There are points in the book that don't move and slow down the story. During one conversation between Jane and Edward the story feels like it's dragging on.""'Sententious sage! So it is: but I sear by my household god not to abuse it.'`You are human and fallible.'`I am: so are you-what then?'`The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely entrusted'"" (144).Over all, the book is excellent. It is captivating and powerful. It is a long read, but worth the time. I would recommend this book to everyone, not only women. Regardless of the gender of the hero, this book shows what one can accomplish no matter what obstacles life throws your way.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My personal favorite,"I first read ""Jane Eyre"" shortly after high school and was completely mesmerized by it. I have read it several times since and I come away with a different view point each time. Jane is the ultimate heroine: she's independant, doesn't bow down to what the ""ideal woman"" should be and doesn't let anything (or anyone) compromise her principles, even the man she loves. The book appeals to the reader both emotionally and intellectually. The emotional aspect of the book is what I love about it. When Rochester tells Jane of his feelings for her, I can the passion of the characters. And later, when Jane leaves him, the agony of the characters is palpable.""Jane Eyre"" always seems to fall under ""Wuthering Heights"" shadow. ""Jane Eyre,"" I believe, is the better novel. It has all the atmosphere of ""Wuthering Heights"", but the romance of Rochester and Jane is far more romantic and believable than that of Cathy and Heathcliff.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Awesome Book,"I read this book when I was 15 for a school English project when a friend recommended it- I'm now 17 and I'm actually in the process of reading the book again. It's just that good. One thing I really like about this book is that Jane isn't pretty, at least not pretty like many other girls around her, and she isn't high class, but she can still have a wonderful life regardless! This is an awesome book and even if you've never read a book like this, try it, and I'm sure you won't regret it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,WOW,"I really loved this novel.......a classic that is still great today. It's a lot more plot driven than your average classic making it an easier read than you would think. When the plot is slower, the rich language is enough to keep you engrossed. I'm a big Jane Austen fan; C. Bronte is a really good author for those who've exhausted Austen's works. She is definitely darker, but just as great!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Touching Classic,"This classic novel tells the tale of an orphaned, moneyless girl named Jane Eyre. When Jane Eyre comes to work as governess for a little French girl at a mansion called Thornfield, life is great. But her world is turned upside down when she finally meets her employer, Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a troubled and temperamental man, yet at the same time sensitive and giving. Jane can't help falling in love with him. But little does Jane know, there still is another mystery at Thornfield that could destroy Jane and all of it's occupants.This classic is an unforgettable read. Mixed with drama, action, and romance, this story is touching and a page turner. Though, at first, it is difficult to read, you get used to the vocabulary and the way the author writes. This book is a must read!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A great book,"Jane Eyre- a book with a story of live. I first saw the film, and that was good for understanding the book better. The book was like the film, natural, sad and a bit romantic. All this experiences whitch Jane had had in her live are written in this book very honest. I think that the writer of this book is a person who knows and understand the problems of people who have a special live. The end and the beginning of this book were very hard and difficult to understand for a normal person. I think the film was better then this book, but it wasn't bad.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre was a very well written book. The book is written by Charlotte Bronte. The book is written in the third person and the author's style is wonderful. Jane is a girl in the beginning and is about five years old. The book explains all about Jane and all of the good and bad events throughout her life. When she becomes a woman, her life gets very exciting and full of adventures.I don't want to give away anything more about the book. I highly recommend Jane Eyre to any young person who has a large vocabulary or has very good dictionary skills, or any adult, so they can understand it. This is certainly a reading challenge, but if you ask anyone who read it, they'll say they loved it!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Best love story ever...,Jane Eyre has always been my favorite story. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is the most intensely moving love relationship I have ever read in a novel. I doubt I will ever come across any as lovely and meaningful again.Jane is an inspiration to many a modern day woman and I would recommend this book be read in high school and it's messages be studied as to their relevance to today.So wonderful a story- so many lessons. I have seen several of the movie versions- my favorite being the A &amp; E version from 1997. The actor who played Mr. Rochester caught his essence perfectly.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,The usual life,It was a truly captivating novel. Never expected theending. Jane gives us a full account of who and what she was and hasbecome.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Determined to follow her conscience,"This book is full of mystery and romance. I have never read anything like it before. It really captivated me.Jane Eyre is true to what she knows is right, no matter how hard the consequences may be. She is poor and plain, yet she doesn't use that as an excuse to live with the man she loves in an improper relationship. She shows rare strength of character and wisdom when she literally runs away from temptation. She knows if she stays with Mr. Rochester, she will never be able to be truly happy, and that despite his promises to the contrary, that she will lose his respect, and she will lose her self-respect. She gives up everything to do what she knows is right, and in the end, she is rewarded in unexpected ways. I will not tell you more because I don't want to spoil it for you.Despite the lessons in this book, it is not moralistic and preachy. It is very well written, and a very enjoyable read. I would recommend it to anyone. I wish I had read it as a teenager!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,One of my all time favorites. I couldn't put it down. If you like period pieces you will love this one.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A favourite,"I heard this as a play when I was 4, and searched the school library for a copy at age 9, much to the Rev Mothers disapproval. I Loved it, and still do. This book has everything mystery, romance, and loads of passion. No wonder the Victorians disapproved.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A book beond words,Yes this book can and is confusing but just like you can't judge a book by it's cover you can't judge a book by it's first five pages. The text is hard and there are confuseing words but the book has such a strong message and good plot that no one should go without reading it!,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the best books I've ever read!!,"I loved Jane Eyre with all my heart! Jane is such a wonderful person and a great role model. The love between Jane and Rochester surpasses all boundaries, especially the physical, and I only wish that everyone could love and be loved as the two main characters in this novel did. I will always cherish Jane Eyre as the beautiful story that it is.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,outstanding!,I was required to read this novel in high school and fell in love with it immediately. The in depth detail and descriptions leave the reader with a great mental image. The emotional descriptions sweep the reader away to feel all of the joy and pain Jane Eyre experiences. It's not just a wonderfully captivating love story; it's a story of an interesting woman's interesting life.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Favorite,I had always wanted to read this after seeing the old movie from before I was born (I'm 59). It tells so much more of Jane Eyre's life a as a young girl.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of My Favorite Love Stories,"Charlotte Bronte knew what she was doing! While at times a bit more descriptive than I like, Jane Eyre tells a fascinating story of love, secrets, and duty. It is a timeless story and a worthy read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Such a bright, beautiful and hopeful story.",I had never heard of Jane Eyre but now understand why it is a classic. Powerfully Christian and human. I wish there were more.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,a must read,"i didn't think i was going to enjoy a classic but, i tried it anyway and it was great. i fell in love with all the characters. a must read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Really good!,I loved the movie but this gave so much more to the story than the movie and a deeper explanation of Rochester's character. I liked the prose better than Bronte's Villette even though I enjoyed that story as well. It was bit easier to read. Too much French in Villette.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Bronte gets wordy,"I recently saw the movie Jane Eyre and was tempted to read the book. The movie was beautifully done, but did leave out some very important events that were described in the book. Overall it was a bittersweet love story... A tale of burning down walls figuratively and literally; of allowing ones self to accept truth and love regardless of station; and of knowing ones self above all. Though Bronte does get a bit wordy in her writing (I'm more partial to Emily's writing vs. Charlotte) this is a rewarding story of strength of heart and perseverance of the spirit.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Great Classic,I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It seemed to be based on historical events. It definitely held my interest.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A True Classic for Modern Times,"Jane could be any modern woman's friend. A working girl, in love with a married man. Her story is told in such a way that you feel like she is sharing it with just you. It's not just a classic. It's a great read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,BRONTE'S BEST,"THIS BOOK HAS BEEN MADE INTO SO MANY MOVIES, BUT THE READ IS WAY BETTER THAN ANY MOVIE.THIS STORY IS ABOUT ABOUT TRUE LOVE AND THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE. THIS IS BRONTE'S BESTBOOK AND THE HEROINE IN THIS STORY IS A SURVIVOR TO THE END.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A real classic.,"I remember this book from high school, and it has not lost it's appeal. The older I get, the more I like it. A real classic. Everyone should read, or 're-read it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Cinderella Story,"The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic Literature--A Must Read,"I had never seen any of the movies before I read the book, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about since the newestJane Eyre [Blu-ray] came out.Jane Eyrehas now become one of my favorite novels. It's great literature, written very beautifully and in which every sentence, every chapter is important to the events in the book. When Jane Eyre begins telling the reader her story, you're immediately drawn in. The book wasn't that difficult for me to read--I occasionally had to look up some words on my Kindle's built in dictionary and I know absolutely no French (some characters speak sentences/words in French, but it's very minor), however this didn't take away from the beauty of the book at all.The whole romance between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is amazing. It's definitely not trashy...it's classy and sophisticated...it's romantic.Charlotte Bronte evens manages to weave in a deep mystery at Thornfield Hall, done VERY successfully. I love mysteries and I had my own hypothesis of ""who-done-it"" and why, and was WRONG. I love that.I don't want to give anything away, if you're a new reader like I was. The movies do not even compare to the book (I went to compare as soon as I finished the book); the book is so much better, it's a delicious classic to read. I was very sad to finally put the book down when I was finished. Jane Eyre is a must read, and definitely a re-read. One of my top favorite books now.For Kindle readers: There are little to no errors in the Kindle Edition ofJane Eyre. Reading on the kindle definitely took out the anxiety factor of reading a thick book. No TOC. The only thing that slightly bothered me was instead of having the whole name of a city/town/county that ended in ""shire"" it was presented as ""---shire"". But not a huge dealbreaker considering it's free. I'm not sure if this is how it was supposed to be presented or not.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,So much better than I remember from high school!,"I have to say I am truly surprised. This is the third time I've read Jane Eyre, and yet the first time I've found anything positive about the experience. I read it once as an 11/12 year old because my mother bought me a lovely red leather-bound edition (apparently she loved the book and thought I would too). I hated it- too hard to read, too much philosophical rambling, no action, annoying heroine, etc. I read it for the second time as a freshman in high school because it was required. I no longer found it hard to read, but I still found Jane annoying and unsympathetic, and I still hated the book.Fast forward to this year and my decision to revisit the classics, including giving Jane Eyre one last try before forever consigning it to the ""I just don't understand how people can like this book"" pile. All I can say is thank goodness I gave it that one last try because the book is a masterpiece. All the philosophical rambling that bored me before is now a central element to the text, superior in many way to the storyline itself. I see now that there is a lot of action for a book of its time, and Jane is certainly not annoying so much as she is inspirational. I mean, she is still a bit pious for my taste, but even so she rebels strongly against the conventions of her time to try to live a life that she finds both emotionally and spiritually satisfying.All of the things that annoyed me when I read this book as a child are the elements that resonate most strongly with me as an adult. I read this book too early, and was too dismissive of it at the time. Like with Anna Karenina, I saw everything in black and white with the merciless clarity of a teenager; I now understand how wonderfully shaded with grey life (and good literature) often is. If you haven't read Jane Eyre since high school, I highly recommend giving it another try- definitely a 5 star!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am Jane Eyre,"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A wonderful surprise,"I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it. It remained fresh and fascinating. What a great book! No wonder Jasper Fforde chose this for Thursday Next's first adventures...",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Wonderful,"I have just finished reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte for the fifth time in my life. I find that every time I read this book I learn something new or interpret a scene differently. I have read this book during all different phases of my life and I find that through every reading I am completely affected with the story even though I know exactly what is going to happen.The premise of the book everyone knows, our story is about the life of Jane Eyre through her childhood living at the home of her aunt who doesn't love or want to keep her to her adult years as governesses for the ward of Mr. Rochester of Thornfield Hall. Jane develops a relationship with her employer that soon blossoms into a fierce love but Mr. Rochester has a secret that he is keeping from Jane that threatens to rip everything apart leaving Jane utterly homeless and alone.This book has been talked about time and time again and I think one of the main reasons it stands the testament of time is that Charlotte Bronte creates a heroine who is so easy to sympathize with and Jane's connections with her audience is felt throughout the entire book and begins on the first page. This to me is the best thing about the book because we know exactly how Jane thinks, and feels and we come to love and adore her for her plainness, intelligence, and spirit. Of course it also helps that our hero Mr. Rochester is so attractive with his brooding, temperamental personality but he is one of my favorite male characters in all of literature because he is so developed I can picture him perfectly in my mind. Every young woman dreams of meeting their Mr. Rochester because he loves Jane with a passion that is hard to believe could exist. So I highly recommend reading this novel because I think it deserves all of the attention it gets. Charlotte Bronte is a master storyteller and uses such elements of horror to create a timeless gothic romance novel.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A must-read for literature lovers and romantic souls,"Though it took me a while to find the time to read this lengthy tome, I am so glad I did, because I absolutely adore this novel. I loved the story, the characters, the blend of romance, mystery, and gothic elements--in short, I loved everything about it!The story is a fictional memoir, which narrates the life of Jane Eyre from the age of 10 to about age 19. We follow Jane from her miserable childhood living with an aunt and three cousins to her sojourn in a charitable boarding school for girls, and then to her station as a governess (at age 18) in the country estate of Mr. Rochester. I will not spoil any of the plot twists (if you don't already know them), for there are several and they make the story truly compelling. Jane herself is an immensely likeable protagonist, right from the start. Even at the tender age of 10, she is full of spirited passion, which makes her real and believable. She grows up before her reader's very eyes, and for me, it was a pleasure to watch her development as a person and character.It has been a long while since a ""classic"" work has so absorbed my attentions and thoughts. Once I found the time to read it, I raced to reach the book's conclusion, and then I was sad when I finished the final page--which to me is always the mark of a truly great book! I wholeheartedly recommend ""Jane Eyre"" to any lover of literature, and to any and all romantic souls...it (and Jane) will not disappoint!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,BRILLIANT!!,"Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :)",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the Classics and free on Kindle,"One of the great gothic romance classics of all time. This novel was written and published in the 1840's, well before women were conceived to be ""gifted"" enough to command an audience. In fact, all the Bronte sisters published under male pseundoyms (Currier Bell, Acton Bell, etc.) in order to be considered serious writers.This novel is a story about enduring character and its ability to strive for the unattainable and inconceivable. A poor orphan raised by an aunt and uncle, Jane is schooled in a loveless environment of neglect. She graduates from this dreary environment and is hired by Rochester to tutor his ward, Adele.The employer-employee relationship between Rochester and Jane grows into a solid friendship. From there, it graduates to love. Unfortunately, there is a shadow over this relationship that precludes a happy ending and Rochester's past comes to haunt him. Fortunately, Jane's strength and enduring character help Rochester surmount his painful past. Her love nurtures Rochester in his darkest hours.This book has continued to be one of my favorites over the years. The Kindle version is free, so if anyone is looking for an excellent book to add to their Kindle collection, I heartily recommend this.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,PERFECTION!!,"I LOVE this edition! It has so many helpful explanations in the back - it's a fantastic work of a beautiful, beautiful book.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Simply Beautiful,"I bought this as a gift for my mother. The clssics have always been in our house but all of her's are worn paperbacks, that are probably over 20 years old. So when I stumbled across these beautifully covered books I was so excited. I wanted to buy all of them and I hope they aren't a limited edition, because I would build a library of classics with these. The book comes with a built in bookmark and the cover is a perfect fit for this beautiful story!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,What makes a classic? It has to be timeless and bring light...like a diamond.,"I always heard of this book but never read it. When I saw the 2011 Jane Eyre with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, I had to read the book because I was hooked.Charlotte Bronte has such talent for words. She brings you to Jane's life, her experiences, her thoughts, her feelings with such clarity that you feel like you are actually there. The narrative proceeds with great pace, just right, not too slow nor too fast. She'll take you to those great houses....those "" Halls "" ... Manor ....those big beautiful homes we see only in travel books.... But she has put life in them. So we see what it is like to actually live there. And what a "" life"" she has put in those houses!Charlotte narrated a life that is so full of passion! Among others.....grief from death, isolation,, fear, courage, sympathy, faith in the goodness of others, and Love! Mr. Rochester is a very attractive character...full of life.The dynamic between a young 18 year old girl and a 38 year old man is realistic enough. The young inexperienced girl had to earn ""life out there in the real world"" before she can actually be on the same level , (somehow) as Mr. Rochester. This is not the typical beautiful underdog being saved by a handsome powerful man. It is more about 2 people completing each other.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,I have read this book a number of times and am always intrigued by the plot. This is also a vocabulary-building book if you enjoy learning new words.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Classic for a Reason,"Even I find it a little hard to believe that I only just now read this classic, and specifically because it was for book club. Even more surprising is that after all this time, I was unaware of how the book ended, so the entire conclusion was unspoiled for me. I am not a huge fan of literature from this period, although I could appreciate the gothic atmosphere and the very puritanical British-ness. Jane is a profound character and it's no wonder she is a favorite literary figure. Her determination is inspiring and I very much enjoyed witnessing her evolution. I don't think I can say much more about this most fundamental novel, other than it was so much better than I expected.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Nicest book I've read,"After reading Jane Eyre 5 times, I learn more and more things. I've noticed new things about ST. JOhn Rivers, Mr. Brocklehurst, etc.I'd highly recommend it for people of whatever interest: romantic-types, looking-for-meaning-in-life types, intersting books, etc.Actually, I became Christian after reading that book. While all the people associated with Christianity are shown in a negative light, Jane's search for freedom and willingness to forego comfort for truth inspired me.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,This is an age-old book that remains a favourite. There is language and an intriguing plot so the reader is left captivated from beginning to end. Worth a read.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Glad I took a chance,"Ok... so truth be told, I only started to read this book because of the movie ""Definately, Maybe"". The way the character in the movie described the book made me think I might like to read it. I was not disapponted. I find that some of the ""classics"" are a bit borning and hard to follow. This one was neither. The orphaned girl hated by her family finds love. And love finds her as well. But it wouldnt make for an interesting story if there werent hills to climb. Over all I would say that this is one of those classics that has most definately earned the classification.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""I Must Resist Those Who Punish Me Unjustly...""","After her uncle dies, Jane Eyre is grudgingly raised by her aunt (bound unwillingly by a promise made to her husband), in a home where she's constantly reminded of her inferior birth, orphaned state and dependence on her relatives. To top it off, she is of unremarkable appearance and is as poor as a church mouse. Yet there is something in Charlotte Bronte's protagonist that sets her apart from the rest of the world, a sense of self-worth and self-discipline that gives her strength and resilience against the many hardships that she'll face in her lifetime.Charlotte Bronte's story begins with Jane as a young girl, living unloved and neglected amongst the untouchable splendour of Gateshead and the Reed family. Jane's only escape is in her love of books and learning, for her spiteful aunt and cousins have no control over the power of her mind - though reading must be done on the sly as John Reed will stoop so far as to deprive her of books he has no interest in himself. When such an event occurs, Jane summons up the spirit to defend herself against her cousin and is duly punished for it. Estranged from human company, her aunt orders her locked in the red room, the chamber in which her uncle dies and which holds imaginary horrors for Jane. This terrifying experience is the catalyst of her childhood which will be remembered in all frightening and unnatural occurrences henceforth in her life.Relief from her extended family comes only when she is called away to school, and despite the poor living conditions and the zealous religious restrictions of Lowood School's patron Mr Brocklehurst, Jane finds a new outlook on life through her somewhat sentimental friendship with the pious Helen Burns. Amazed at Helen's patience and resilience with teachers that constantly heckle and beat her, Jane discovers Helen's devotion to God which puts to shame her own practice of fighting back at those who wrong her. An important stage in her inner growth, Jane takes upon herself Helen's teachings, survives illness at the school and enters the world as a governess.It is here that the story begins proper (not that the proceedings are unimportant), as Jane takes up a governess position for the young ward of Mr Rochester at Thornfield, stretching her wings for the first time. Here she befriends the elderly housekeeper Fairfax and her young charge Adele, and finally comes to meet her master, the intimidating and elusive Mr Rochester. Sharing a prickly and awkward acquaintance at first, Rochester soon recognises the intelligence and wittiness hiding behind Jane's modesty and plainness. Respect turns to friendship, and from there comes the first inklings of love...But something is amiss in Thornfield in the novel's most overtly Gothic thread. Jane becomes increasingly aware of sinister goings-on in the house: mad laughter rings throughout the halls at night. Mr Rochester's bedchamber is set alight and only Jane's quick action saves him from death. A stranger arrives at the house whose presence upsets Rochester and who is found badly wounded that very night. Jane suspects the quirky housemaid Grace Poole, but ultimately this mystery has a far more devastating answer, which once more upturns Jane's life and ambitions.Charlotte Bronte's heroine is one of literature's most unique and introspective characters; an ever evolving and maturing individual, who constantly searches her soul and conscious for meaning and identity. Jane's self control is remarkable, as his her ability to rationalise problems and follow through with the decisions that she makes. By today's standards, where self-indulgence and reward-systems are the norm, Jane's state of mind is like a bucket of cold water over the head. When the moment of Jane's great choice comes, she reacts exactly as should be expected, not as some overly-virtuous, too-good-to-be-true Victorian girl. Unlike other heroines, who might be repulsed or frightened at Rochester's offer, Jane is very sorely tempted. It is from herself and the knowledge of her own weakness that she flees, not from Rochester and his pleas. In this moment the strength of her conviction and will-power is sure to impress.It is important to know that this is not just a romance novel, though it is certainly the driving force of the latter half of the novel. What is most fascinating about the relationship between Jane and Rochester is the complex power struggle that goes on between them, something that often does away with romantic disillusions and deals with the practical and often uncomfortable components of attachment. Mr Rochester is Jane's employer, her social superior and a man considerably older than our teenage protagonist, yet Jane is constantly attempting to exert a sense of control over him and her feelings for him, knowing the cost that would come in succumbing to the man she describes as nearly taking the place of Almighty God in her estimation. The games they play with each other, the testing and the intrigues formed between them are riveting stuff and explore the darker power-struggles of male and female relationships that are almost always lost in typical romance novels. Bronte creates an astonishing amount of equality between the two lovers, for as the novel progresses Rochester becomes more and more reliant on Jane.Jane Eyre is in many ways a feminist novel, addressing to its contemporary audience the drudgery and monotony of female existence that ""confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags"". Jane's `adventures' through school and into the world of employment, her experiences of passionate love and destitution in the wilderness, reflect Charlotte Bronte's own struggles in a man's world. Most (if not all) of the men that Jane meets in her travels attempt to control her in one way or another, and Jane is constantly fighting to walk her own path. As she says at the crucial point in her life: ""I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself."" The loneliness apparent in this passage, and the aloneness in which she spends most of her time is what makes the character of Jane so memorable - here is girl that has no one to look out for her but herself, and yet she keeps her kindness, faith and honour without falling into self-pity or bitterness.""Jane Eyre"" is one of those classic books that everyone's heard of - but it's up to you to take the next step and read it for yourself.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Excellent,"The epic story of Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's 'poor and plain' 19th century heroine, is a rare and wonderful combination of intelligent prose and keen emotion. It's a sweeping masterpiece of a love story, and a book which, even now, remains as accessible and valid as it did upon its first release.Jane, the heroine, is an orphan, being raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. Tired of her troublesome charge, Mrs. Reed sends Jane to board at Lowood Charity School, where she discovers a new way of life, sometimes as cruel as her time at Gateshead, sometimes full of friendship and laughter. Presently, she accepts the job of Governess to the precocious daughter of Mr. Rochester in Thornfield Hall, and falls in love. She discovers inner strength and self-worth through the redemptive power of that love.Unlike the novels of Jane Austen, Bronte's heroine is from an underprivileged class, and the mood of this story is generally sombre. However, compared to 'Shirley', or Emily Bronte's masterpiece 'Wuthering Heights', 'Jane Eyre' takes what is essentially a sorrowful tale and imbues it with vivid, if brief, descriptions of happiness and love. A sense of belonging pervades the latter half of the story, thrown into high relief by several traumatic events, and culminating in Jane achieving her heart's true desire - a family of her own.It's a more straightforward and rewarding book than most 19th century epics, and for that, it's a better way of introducing oneself to 19th century literature. Bronte's acute awareness of the complexities of human emotion is palpable, and her heroine Jane displays a sense of isolation and self-reliance not found in many other novels, contemporary or otherwise. This is the hook, this is what draws the reader to the character of Jane, she is hard and self-sufficient, without resorting to bitterness or introversion. This subtle contrast forces us to empathise with Jane's plight, and we are all the more satisfied by the story's end.Basically a love story played out against the backdrop of harsh, austere 19th century rural England, 'Jane Eyre' is a book you will return to, again and again. It's romantic, gothic, sparse and, conversely, lush, and truly deserving of its status as Classic. Buy it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Plainly the best,"The title character of this novel is unusual, indeed, extremely rare - Marian Halcombe in The Woman in White is the only other such romantic literary heroine I can think of - in that she is not physically attractive. She has neither looks nor fortune. Most romantic heroines have the former but not the latter. It is Jane's character alone that the hero falls in love with. It is clear from the writing that Charlotte herself was unattractive and painfully aware of it. Strangely, the reading public have been unable to accept this, the very element of the book that makes it a perfect romance. The portrait of Charlotte that is most often reproduced is an idealized effort that makes her look beautiful. And whenever a screen adaptation is made of the book, the actress playing Jane is always beautiful. This reduces the theme to that of a rich man falling for a pretty servant girl. As always with classic literature, if you have only seen the movie, you emphatically do not know the book.My first Bronte novel was Emily's Wuthering Heights, which I found very disappointing, with its heavy-breathing masochistic melodrama. But sister Charlotte is a writer of a very different caliber. From the first few pages, the reader knows they are in the hands of a great artist. The heartrending portrait of childhood with which the story opens is based on the author's own experiences, and it shows.The book is not without flaws. The latter stages of the plot are carried along by a series of totally incredible coincidences and there is rather more Victorian melodrama than most modern readers would care for. But it remains, with its Plain-Jane heroine and its unlikely hero (in the end, he satisfies none of the conventional requirements of a romantic hero) the perfect romance. Never was the power of love more satisfyingly expressed.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,How on earth can anyone find Jane Eyre boring??,"I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag. I'm 53, and I've read it about once a year since I was 12. . .never once as a school assignment, much less a punishment. I've read for pleasure all my life. . .voluminously, addictively. . . and Jane Eyre is my alltime, number-one favorite novel. Dull?!? Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best! It has a bright, strong, creative, misunderstood and abused kid heroine who nearly dies of her maltreatment, but survives, thrives, ignores her era's view of women as brainless porcelain dolls, experiences passionate love on her own terms rather than his, refuses to give up her enormous integrity for a false heaven, lives homeless and nearly dies of it rather than become anyone's plaything, fends off patriarchal religion with rare spirit and honesty, and finally. . .well, I'll let you read the absolutely splendid ending for yourselves, if you haven't been rendered incapable of understanding it by today'salleged educational system. Suffice it to say that it was sufficiently radical in its day to get the author a lot of hate mail. . .to which she replied with a spirit that would've made Jane proud.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Beloved Classic & Remarkable Literary Work - B&N Edition Includes Excellent Introduction and Notes!,"Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" has been one of my favorite novels since I first read it in high school. It is one of those special books which can be read and savored over and over, and seems to improve with each reading. The tale is narrated by Miss Eyre, herself, inviting a special and intimate relationship with the reader. It is through Jane that we meet and grow to care about, or hate, so many of the memorable characters one becomes acquainted with on these pages. And it is through her narrative, first as a little girl, then as a young woman, that Jane's complex persona is revealed. From an early age her morality, wit, determination, sheer grit and romanticism are evident.Published in 1847, the novel, at first glance, appears to be another well written gothic romance, of the kind so popular in the Victorian Age, with its mystery, horror, brooding hero, touch of the melodramatic, and dark castle-like setting. The rise of poor orphaned Jane, who against all odds, redeems her tormented hero through her steadfast love, is really not unique at all. Charlotte Bronte did not, however, write a mere romance, no matter how riveting the read. Throughout, the author makes some serious statements about women's equality, the treatment of children, and of women forced into a dependent state during the Victorian epoch, religious hypocrisy, romantic relationships between men and women, the nature of true love, and the development of self. This is a beautifully written work of fiction which combines a riveting storyline, compelling characters, vivid descriptions along with a powerful testimony about the period in which the book was written.Young Jane, orphaned at an early age, is grudgingly taken-in by her Aunt, Mrs. Reed, who seems to despise the child. The Reed children are spoiled rotten, and the eldest son is somewhat of a sadist who abuses his young cousin terribly. Aunt Reed always finds a reason to blame Jane for the household's ills. When the boy takes his torture too far and Jane attempts to defend herself, her aunt has her locked in the room where her uncle died, terrifying the poor girl into hysteria. Unwilling to care for the girl any longer, Mrs. Reed packs her off to the harsh Lowood School, a miserable charitable institution which is more like a prison than a place of education. Lowood's despicable headmaster, Rev. Brockelhurst, does everything in his power to break Jane's spirit. At one point, when he asks Jane how to avoid going to hell, she defiantly responds, ""I must stay well and not die.""A particularly compassionate teacher recognizes Jane's intelligence and sensitivity and befriends the girl. When Jane graduates she stays to teach at Lowood until her mentor leaves to marry. Jane then decides it is time for a change, and applies for a position as a governess. She is offered a job at the distant Thornfield Manor. Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield's housekeeper, welcomes her warmly and introduces her to the staff and to little girl who will be her pupil, the precocious Adele. She is not, however, introduced to all the household's inhabitants - especially not to one who inhabits the uppermost floor. Thornfield's owner, Mr. Rochester, (one of my favorite literary heroes), is away when our protagonist arrives, yet it is he who will have a most profound effect on her life - and she on his.If you have not read ""Jane Eyre"" yet, why wait any longer? If you have not reread it for a few years, now's the time! My highest recommendations!The Barnes and Noble Classic Edition provides an excellent Introduction and Notes by Susan Ostrov Weisser, a Professor of English at Adelphi University where she specializes in nineteenth-century literature and women's studies. Her research centers on women and romantic love in nineteenth-century literature, as well as on contemporary popular culture. This is a hardcover book. Highly recommended!JANA",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Well performed reading of a Gothic classic,"Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge. Her fitting voice and intonation naturally rise and fall between Jane's contrasting Victorian reserve and fiery passion. Whereas some reader's tones obviously change between cuts, Erickson's are seemless. Her speed and diction make the story very clear.This unabridged performance seems to sell for cheaper than the others, but that is not because the performance is lacking.Technical issues: Each CDs track number goes up to around 97, 98, or 99.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the very best,"I have been passionate about Jane Eyre for going on twenty years now. It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the ""martyrdom"" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am Jane Eyre,"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Epitomizes its genre,"More than a simple love story, a gothic romance, a Victorian novel, or even a female picaresque work, Jane Eyre is, quite simply, a wonderful book. Written, as it was, in Victorian England by a female author, Jane Eyre has occasionally been pigeonholed as a garden variety gothic romance. It is much more than this, however: not only is it a genuine classic, it epitomizes its genre. There are several factors that set it above the pack. For one, it is extremely well-written: Bronte's characterization is masterful and the plot is well-developed. One comes to identify with the character of Jane, who narrates, and the other characters in the book, most of whom are well-drawn, rounded characters. The book also features other elements which are unusual for a book of its kind and which were genuinely new at the time. For starters, take its protagonist, the title character: she is not beautiful, like Edith Wharton's Lily Bart; she is not rich, like most of Jane Austen's female characters; she is not ambivalent and wish-washy like Kate Chopin's Edna Pontellier; she is not an intellectual. Jane is a well-drawn, rounded, truly believable character -- and a genuinely likable one. The reader comes to empathize and identify with her. Strong-willed, independent, and indefatigable, Jane is not a hard-to-like character like the aforementioned Edna Pontellier from The Awakening; the book could almost be called a female picaresque novel, were she not so practical and solid a character. Also setting the book above its ilk are several dark story details that set the book above the of the typical love story. Bronte also uses the book as a medium to criticize certain aspects of Victorian culture: the inhumane and non-emphatic treatment of the poor by the rich, the denial of the pursuit of happiness, the plight of orphans and other who had no well-defined place in society, the often cruel sternness of church and other authority figures, among much else. Bronte also pauses from time to time to take on spiritual and quasi-philosophical elements, which give the book an added depth and sophistication. With all of this, Bronte succeeds in bringing the book out of the sphere of mere feminist literature: its universal theme and eclectic contents set it above the works of Austen and Chopin, among others. Though many aspects of the novel show it to be a clear product of the Victorian era, the book, with its just-mentioned strengths, is a universal work that will endure for centuries yet to come. In this way, it is much more applicable to our present day than works such as, say, The House of Mirth, which deal primarily with ephemeral concerns. On top of all this, it is a wonderful and delightful read. What we have here is a true classic.This is essential reading for any fan of romances, gothic literature, or Victorian literature in general; readers looking for a truly great and easily-accessible classic need also look no farther.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Timeless Tale,"I personally resent both the opinion that teenagers cannot appreciate good literature and the notion that all classics are dull. I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Perfection of Types,"The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true. In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin. There may have been other gothic romances similar to ""Jane Eyre"" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about ""Manfred"", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type. He's sensitive, yet abrupt. Demanding, yet tender. Proud, yet remorseful. Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester. She's tough and stern, yet playful. She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her. And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not). Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"STUNNING, MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!","Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me.

She is praised not only for her beautiful and eloquent writing but also for her captivating stories that fascinates readers of all generations. In this riveting novel that many considered the most prominent literary work of Charlotte Bronte, the life of a 19th century young English woman, Jane Eyre, is portrayed vividly. It is a life of shocking reality, a combination of misery and at the same intrigue and triumphs. Starting from her youthful years, she is met with great obstacles. As a small girl, Jane lived under the scrutiny of her cold hearted aunt, who not only showed bias but also cruelty. Sent to Logwood School at a young age, Jane is cast aside from the other students. Constantly tortured by her teachers and declared as a definite sign of evil and wickedness, she has grown up through a bitter childhood into a woman of great determination and tremendous courage. Striving in a world meant for the wealthy and fortunate, Jane is granted a job as a governess in the mansion of a rich yet mysteriously shrouded man, Mr. Rochester, who only visits the place years at a time. Handsome and prosperous, Mr. Rochester has had his own life of torment, one complicated by deception and remorse, and a shadowed past of beguilement concealed by intricate lies that haunted him for years. Yet, either by coincidence or fate, he unexpectedly went back to his mansion right after Jane's arrival. Inspired and warmed by Jane's calmness and wisdom, the pair soon becomes entangled in a complicated labyrinth of romance mingled with obscurity and dark secrets.

Over the years, I have repeatedly reread the novel. Like all classics, everytime I read it, it offers an array of previously unfelt emotions and of course remains as enchanting as ever. To say very least, it is like your favorite soap opera that you watched while growing up, has characters and events you nearly can never forget, and due to its ageless charm, you revisit those times and emotions through all the reruns and remakes. Maybe the weight of my years of association makes this novel unforgettable for me, but trust me, read it and you will definitely feel the romance, the pain, the emotion, the passion: and maybe like me, return to read it again!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,a great classic,"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a touching love story from the 19th century. Within the first few pages you will be swept up into a poor orphaned girl's troublesome life. Jane Eyre's sorrows, triumphs, and love are woven together in an almost magical way that keeps you reading until the end. There is mystery, suspense, and drama in this book, and also humor and happiness.Jane is an orphan who was raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. She was sent off to a charity bording school called Lowood. There our 'poor and plain' heroine spends eight years. With sad and happy memories from Lowood, Jane departs to become a governess at Thornfield Hall. Little does she know of the mystery in the attic or the love that awaits her.I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good classic. It's really a magical tale that is worth reading over and over again.The reading is moderately hard, it is probably about high school reading level. I loved it, andunderstood it, even though I am in 8th grade.I think that when I finished this book I was slightly changed from what I was when I started this book. I can really relate to Jane Eyre, and that is why I think that girls tend to like this novel more than boys. Also because it is a romance,but who knows, it really depends on what kind of person you are.Jane Eyre is a passionate novel that sketches the way women felt in the 19th century, and what they went through. Jane Eyre's passion pours out of her so strongly, especially in this sentence:""...my soul began to expand, to exault, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into an unhoped-for-liberty""",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Author,"I thought I was seeing things, so I enlarged the picture of the cover: does it *really* say Jane Eyre, by Emily Bronte? I know that it's the thrift edition, but was it necessary to be so thrifty that they credited the wrong sister? Maybe I wouldn't have been so ""up in arms"" if this weren't my favourite novel of all time... I still remember reading it for the first time... wondering about the mystery and fear surrounding Grace Poole (don't worry: I've given nothing away). Ms *Charlotte* Bronte has written a romantic, mysterious, heartbreaking page-tuner of a novel, and everytime I get to the last page, I'm bereft. Read it, at any cost...I see that the people who've dissed the novel have largely been *forced* to read it at school etc. Shame that they feel this way, because it's one of the most powerful novels with a woman protagonist that has ever been written.Yes, Charlotte has written what feels to our 21st-century eyes like a romantic piece of pap, but consider this in the context of the time: it was written by a woman (albeit under a male pseudonym initially), about a woman character who was in control of her own life, and able to make her own life decisions, rather than being under the male yoke. This was groundbreaking stuff, and actually manages to subvert the apparent genre. Read from this perspective, this novel is revolutionary, and far from pap.(By the way, if you want to read a *real* Emily Bronte novel, then it's probably Wuthering Heights you'd be after)",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Simply Gorgeous,"I don't especially know why I picked &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; off my shelves recently. It had been sitting there since I read it when I was younger and whilst perusing said shelves for something to amuse myself with, I came across it. I thank the Lord that I did because it's been the best read I've had since &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot;. The plot: compelling and captivating. The narrative: descriptive, philosophical, flawless. The charaters: both believable and lovable. I was so engrossed I found myself getting angry when plans went awry and on the verge of tears when they went right. I recommend that you DO NOT read this while you are young, as a previous reviwer suggested... I did so the first time around and in no way shape or form was able to appreciate its subtleties and sheer elegance to a thousandth of the degree I do now. It IS romance; but even if that's &quot;not your bag&quot;, you'll enjoy the pure power of Ms. Bronte's work. READ THIS BOOK: you won't regret it. Definately in my top 5 of all time.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre--great novel,"This gothic classic has more than a dash of melodrama--cruelty to orphans, wicked step-aunts, a darkly handsome quixotic hero, a monster in the attic, catastrophe and more. Yet Jane Eyre transcends the thrilling parts of the book to become one of English's greatest novels.The novel is not without weakness; the entire St. John section is a bit overdramatic and somewhat contrived; yet it is essential to the novel not only for the symmetry but also to contrast a life that would only satisfy the flesh and sacrifice the soul (Mr. Rochester's proposal) versus a life sacrificing the flesh entirely for the sake of the soul (St. John.) Jane Eyre never falters from her conviction that, to be whole and true to oneself, both the spiritual and the carnal sides must be fulfilled. This was a daring proposal in Victorian England, and Jane Eyre was labeled ""coarse"" by one critic. Even more daring was that this philosophy was espoused by a woman writer, which is why Charlotte Bronte wrote the book under a gender-neutral pseudonym (Currer Bell.)Why should you read this classic? Initially, Jane Eyre can be enjoyed for its well-told and enjoyable story--very romantic and exciting. What makes Jane Eyre an enduring classic is that you can read it and re-read it many times over for the perfection of its structure. I have a hard time choosing between Jane Eyre and Eliot's Middlemarch as ""best English novel.""",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Classic in Every Sense of the Word,"Jane Eyre is as perfect as a book can be. It's the wonderful, multi-layered story of a poor orphan who falls in love with a man of the British upper class.Jane Eyre is a fully-fleshed out character who is, in many ways, more modern than her nineteenth century counterparts. She is definitely a character to &quot;fall in love with&quot; and one that is truly unforgettable.Although some of the events in Jane Eyre are more than a little far-fetched, the plot is so enjoyable we can easily forgive Bronte a few minor faults. The pages simply fly by as we want to learn more about Jane and Mr. Rochester and their ultimate fate, both together and apart.Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word and extraordinarily enjoyable as well.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Moving, Well-Written and Captivating.....","but definitely for the more educated. If you don't appreciate literature, I would say...don't read it, you won't like it. I love it...it is my favourite book of all time, hands down, but from what I have read and heard from others, it seems that the a person merely looking for a feministic book, or something easy to read that dosn't take much intellect, would not like it at all. As far as the content.... Charlotte Bronte had such a grasp of the wonderful pathos that love can fill a person with, it's incredible. The characters are well-portrayed, and you really get to know Jane and Mr. Rochester, which is more I can say than many works of it's day. I would say that Jane Eyre is one of the ultimate triuphs of literature.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Flight of Hope,"The search for freedom is a common underlying theme that can be found in many novels. Charlotte Bronte really emphasized this theme in Jane Eyre. This novel illustrates the path a strong young woman takes in her search for contentment. As she travels from place to place it becomes obvious that she is seeking a true home. The repetition of bird motifs throughout the novel is a device that accentuates the theme of freedom. In paying close attention to these motifs one can see that Jane is actually equated with a bird. Like a bird Jane Eyre is constantly in flight in search of her dreams. Her ""spirit followed on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to and ideal Heaven"" (333). The comparison of Jane to a bird, when understood, is very important to the overall meaning of the novel. At the time Charlotte Bronte wrote the novel her ideas were pretty radical, considering that it was unheard of for a woman to be independent and free willed, which are the key aspects of Jane Eyre's character. The romanticism and feminism of this novel is inspirational. I strongly recommend Jane Eyre to any woman who is not afraid to follow her own dreams.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"A little boring , but enjoyable.","As an orphan, Jane has no money and no one to care for her. After enduring hardships with an aunt who doesn't love her and struggling at a strict boarding school, Jane has come to a place where she may be able to find happiness and love. This novel starts out slow, but the action picks up, developing the romance and the mystery in the novel. Charlotte Bronte uses imagery and numerous allusions in the novel. The most notable allusion is the bird allusions. This bird motif suggests freedom or independence, specifically, the independence of Jane. This theme, on a broader scheme, suggests women's independence, a subject that is not uncommon, but unorthodox at this time period. Another common allusion is a biblical allusion. These set a religious tone in the novel. Not only does Bronte allude to the Bible, she also uses religion to play a role in the development of Jane, most notably the religious boarding school and St. John Rivers. These things seem to have a negative effect on Jane, which cause her to sometimes stray a bit from religion. Even though she is negatively effected by those two elements, Jane still has religious morals that are found in the novel. Jane is honest and is not afraid to speak her mind to anyone. One can find many elements that make this book enjoyable and well worth reading. Even though starting out slow, the action intensifies with plot twists and suspense that make one rush to finish this novel.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Formula for the time period.,"Don't let the title of this review deceive you. I really enjoyed this book, very much. It does, however, follow a strikingly familiar formula, as do many of the &quot;strong heroine&quot; novels of the nineteenth century.Jane Eyre is a girl orphaned at a young age. She endures a very Dickensian treatment at the all-girls orphanage she is relegated to by her less than sympathetic relations, after being branded a trouble-maker, and having a bad character, and a deceitful dispostion.She survives the orphanage, only to be enlisted in the employ of a Mr. Rochester, as tutor and nanny to his charge, Adela. She is at once intrigued, if not a bit repelled by his brusque nature, and yet finds herself falling in love with him.Jane is caught up in the mystery of the 'tenant' on the third floor, a dangerous, diabolical person who places Jane's life, as well as Rochester's, in jeopardy, as Jane goes about her duties, all the while growing more and more amorous of Rochester.Eventually the identity of the 'tenant' is revealed, and Jane must chose between love and sense of duty. Being the forthright person that she is, she of course chooses duty, much to the heartbreak of both herself and Rochester, who has grown as enamored of this plain, headstrong creature as she has of him.Jane Eyre plays out in a very formulaic manner, much like many novels of the same ilk, but it is a wonderful read. The characters are engaging and entertaining. The story holds a few twists and turns, and delivers a very well-realized conclusion.For anyone who had this book thrust upon them in their teens, give it another try. For those who did not, it is well worth a first look.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Wish I could meet Jane Eyre,"Reviewers may say that as an author, Charlotte Bronte does not quite equal the best classical writers, or that her plot is too contrived, or that her dialogue is too stilted. None of these things matters, because in Jane Eyre, Bronte created a character whom I believe has no equal in fiction.Jane Eyre is a survivor in an age much more merciless than today. Condemned and degraded as a little girl by adults she trusted, she never loses her grip on her self-respect. Although she is reviled by her guardians and boarding school authorities, she retains not only her belief in herself but her innate goodness. Instead of returning harsh treatment with bitterness, she develops a character containing equal parts of toughness and kind benevolence.Her integrity is perceived by an employer whose deepest need is to recapture his own integrity, which he believes lost. Jane's guarded response to him forms much of the book's plot. Jane emerges quietly triumphant in a world in which she encountered hostility and love and ignorance and enlightenment, and met it all head on.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the best books I ever read!,"...and that's saying a lot coming from me. I read about 2 books a week but none has captured me the way &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has. Many of the reviewers here have said that the vocabulary is difficult but this is what makes Charlotte Bronte such a fabulous writer. She was a poet before a novelist and all of her dialogue is written in prose. I've seen the Orson Welles version of this movie but a movie couldn't possibly do justice to this book. Ms Bronte not only relates us to Jane Eyre but with the prosaic descriptions she allows the reader to feel what Jane Eyre feels. Also, the book is timeless...unrequited love, jealousy, rage, passion..will never go out of style which is why even readers 100 years from now will still be unable to put this book down. I've recommended this book to my daughter as my mother has recommended this book to me and as her mother recommended to her. I know this book will continue being passed from generation to generation and I plan on reading it a second time.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,I pity those who must read this childish peice of foolery:,"Alright, I admit that I am a student and was forced to read this book.That said, I still do not understand what would ever bring anyone to consider this work remotely good, much less classic. Ms. Bronte's writing, while properly structured, lacks any ability to move or inspire a reader. Her character-- for there is only one character, the rest are mere background-- is a selfish brat who eternally whines about the unfairness of the world, except of course when that unfairness works in her favor, when she either glories in other's pain or trying to inflict more upon them. ... Bronte strains one's gullibility often throughout the novel, especially in its conclusion where she apparrently runs out of ideas and starts inserting magic and telepathy into an otherwise reality-based novel for the purpose of bringing the characters back together. She clumsily tries to blugeon the reader into the appropriate emotional state by cutting out any scene which is not miserable (including a goodly eight years in which Jane has friends, a good lifestyle, and a promising career-- the author claims they contain ""no significant interest""), and her lack of subtlety has on numerous occasions given me an actual headache.As to the love story- where is it? The plot of the book consists of two things only: a small child growing up to get revenge on all those who she disliked as a child (everyone), and an adolescent sexual fantasy involving breaking a proud spirit and mutilating it at one's pleasure. (""Reader, I married him.""--of course HE had nothing to do with it.) Oh, yes, and i forgot: hatred of everything and blindness to all that is good. That's three things, i guess. These bleary tales are obviously the product of a small and vicious person, and I sincerely hope that if another Charlotte Bronte comes into being, she becomes a recluce and leaves us normal, relatively happy people alone. (The original did one, it seems, but not the other.)This book, if it has any value at all, is to show the world the darkness of man's nature. If one wishes such a book, read Macbeth or Lord of the Flies, for at least their authors knew how to tell a story.Do not buy this book.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,"Mildless drivel with sickening, neverending irony.","Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match. Mrs. DeFarge also being Little Girl with Bad Past is nothing compared to this. Honestly, what are the chances of stuff like this REALLY happening? The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick. Now, if it just so happened that Mr. Rochester was Jane's father, and his wife was her sister...Now that might have sparked a little more interest.",negative

Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it.

From this angle, the book seems to go at a pious anti-piety, as odd as that may sound. The book also seems to show some beginnings of feminism, which I am not a fan of, since it is anti-Biblical.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Popcorn anyone?,"Jane Eyre is the story of an orphan girl and her adventurous journey through life. She starts out in the home of her aunt and three cousins all of whom despise her. She was left there as a young girl with her caring uncle when both of her parents died. Her uncle died shortly later and Jane was left in less than desirable conditions. After a blood-curdling incident her frustrated aunt sends her off to boarding school where, for the most part, she is treated worse than she was in her aunt's home. From there she becomes a governess and takes care of a little girl for a man whom she later falls in love with. This is where the story really gets interesting as several twists and turns take the couple towards an unexpected ending.Charlotte Bronte, the author, has a writing style typical of the romance period. Her vivid descriptions, while being wonderfully picturesque, can at times be lengthy. There are so many images of gardens and mountains and sunsets that the plot often gets lost somewhere along the way. The story can also become frustrating at times. I often longed to yell at the characters and set them in the right direction as they slowly picked their way through the tangled mess they were enveloped in.Bronte's heart was in the right place with this one. The story is one of a great love and an extraordinary woman. Jane Eyre is a one in a million kind of girl whose life story is definitely one worth telling. However, it is one that could have been told much more simply. There are parts of the novel that don't seem to have any real purpose other than to fill pages. They don't give away anything as to how she is going to end up. It merely confuses and frustrates the reader into utter boredom. So while the story and writing are both tasteful, Jane Eyre can only be taken in small doses.",neutral

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Less than interesting...,"or engaging, or involving, or insightful or brilliant.Jane Eyre is not a book that is celebrated because of its overwhelming greatness, but because it was 'dared' to be written in the 19th century- by a woman, no less, and contained female sexuality at a time when any sexuality was rather frowned upon.Well, I am all for the courage and the steps forward taken in writing this book, but that doesnt mean its particularly interesting, absorbing, or anything else that makes it worth your while, or anyone elses.I can, and have, read such classics as 'A Tale and Two Cities', other works by Dickens, 'The Scarlet Pimpernel', etc. All those books were of the same period but at least were quite interesting and over all a great experience.Jane Eyre is neither.All of the dreary symbology (chestnut tree, mad wives, mansions burning down) and all of the prophetic dreams do nothing to prop this book up. Charlotte Bronte makes ghosts seem dull and spirits and fairies positively mind-numbing. All of Jane Eyre's encounters are couched in a style thats drier and staler than moldy bread. Fire? Murder? wild spirits? its all here. But none of it is the least bit worthwhile to read.In the end, we have a heroine that has wandered from place to place and eventually settles down ith her past love, Rochester, once he has 'redeemed' himself by his courage in trying to save his mad wife (in the attempt he loses his sight and an arm).In typically fairy tale fashion, Rochester gains his sight back. I have a suspicion that he would have grown another arm if we gave hima few more years.The book that Jane Eyre reminds me most of is 'The Scarlet Letter'. If anything, this is more boring.This dull, mind-numbing book is about as entertaining as watching fungus grow. The fact that its riddled with 'deep symbology' makes it not one bit more interesting.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Horrid Illustrations for a Great Book.,"Excuse me? Is this edition a joke?I enjoyed Jane Eyre quite thoroughly, and I will not summarize the plot here. It has been done elsewhere. This review concerns this particular edition.Perhaps I might be harsh, but it looks to me as if Dame Darcy paid a fifth grader to do the illustrations in this book. She could use some serious formal training. Perhaps she was attempting to capture some type of gothic element in her illustrations, but these poor, poor drawings do not enhance (in fact they serve as a detriment to) the beautiful language of charlotte bronte's work. They really are quite terrible, heavy-handed drawings; Darcy really should bruch up on her pen work.Perhaps they were executed under serious time constraints? Perhaps all she had access to were cheap bic pens and a half used crayola water color set? Perhaps Penguin books was looking for an illustrator to do these illustrations for dirt cheap and she?

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am Jane Eyre,"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Kindle Edition -- Decent choice,"For reviews on the story itself, see other reviews. For a specific review on ""Should I get this version on my Kindle?"" here you go.Table of contents that I saw (not interactive if there is one), but it's not necessary here, this is a story that you just keep clicking ""next page"" and pick up where you set down. Minimal (if any) errors and well set up. Next chapter always starts at the top of a page which makes it always a good place to stop.Kindle vs. Hardcopy -- one nice thing is that there are a lot of words considered either purely poetical or old or middle English, so no longer or not commonly used and if you move your cursor to the word on the kindle, it will automatically define it. Always useful, but especially where there are many such words.Well worth the buck!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Absorbing & Well Written,"""Jane Eyre"" by Charlotte Bront is an 1847 novel published as ""Jane Eyre. An Autobiography"" under the nom de plume of ""Currer Bell"". The novel is told in first person narrative and goes through five distinct stages in Jane's life. In spite of many dark elements the novel has strong elements of right vs. wrong as well as morality.The orphan Jane Eyre, brought up by an duty bound aunt by marriage is having a miserable childhood. The family is spoiled and socially fixated, considering the orphan in their mists beneath them and bans Jane from her cousins. After an incident with her cousin John, Jane is sent to a school called Lowood where the moral pillar of her time finds herself subject to the hypocritical minister who runs the place. Jane endures the school even though she has been branded a liar and subject to a starvation diet as well as other miseries - but she remains faithful to standards which would break any other mortal.Reaching adulthood, Jane leaves Lowood to become a governess for Mr. Rocchester at his home called Thornhill. Mr. Rochester wins Jane's love and respect even though she knows he is harboring a secret. Rochester asks for Jane's hand in marriage, even though she keeps remind him what a poor, plain girl she is. At the last moment the marriage is thwarted, Jane flees Thorhill all alone and without a penny to her name. However, Jane finds her way back to society and moves up the social ladder only to make her way back to Mr. Rochester to discover his painful secret.I can certainly see why ""Jane Eyre"" is considered a classic. Bront's use of strong language , rhetorical brilliance and lovely narrative are certainly impressive. The author also had the guts to tackle many social issues head on, something that we, at this voyeuristic age, seem to take for granted. Even though this book was not meant to be historical, several decades later I found it captivating to read about the day-to-day living of 1800's England.The book described the fascinating social ladder of the 1800's where governesses (nannies/teachers) were far below their employers, yet often better educated. I felt that Jane's assertions to Rochester that she is his equal was something that was simply frowned upon a society which thrives on ambiguities.I found myself increasingly interested in the outcome of the story, the Rochester secrets, Jane's wit and eventual outcome. The personal story of Jane Eyre is very absorbing and well written. Bront's observations are poignant and engaging, her storytelling, when she's not of on a tangent, is admirable.But,oh the tangents... as much as absorbing as the book was, when the characters start going off on departures about religion and morality I almost felt as if I was being scolded. The huge amount of storytelling which is meant to be nothing but a filler got to be annoying after a hundred pages or so. The only conflict in the book is between Jane and Rochester, the rest of the book is filled with Jane being Jane, preaching to the reader about morality, virtues, temptations which might have some charm, but certainly isn't interesting.My favorite book, Don Quixote is known for its unbalanced structure, but the Quixote chapters are completely separate from the stories within a story parts. In ""Jane Eyre"" Bront tells the tale in logical progression which is structured around the protagonist. However, the consistency of the narrative is done at the expense of the overall strength of the whole.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A true classic. This Kindle edition leaves some things to be desired.,"What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals. For formatting, you might be able to find better.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Woman of Great Importance,"Jane Eyre is a masterpiece.I thoroughly enjoyed it. The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned ""Wuthereing Heights"", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane and Mr. Rochester,"I'll confess I wasn't particularly looking forward to ""Jane Eyre"" when I started. I wanted to read it because I should read it, and because it's a travesty I haven't read it - until now. I assumed it would be dry, at times forcefully witty - a hunt for a man and a conquest. That sort of thing.Not a bit of it!Charlotte Bront creates in Jane a character with whom I find much in common: her manner of thought, her silented spirit, her tendency to love fully and passionately - to sketch, to think, to be content within herself.As a child she is abused by her stepmother and detested for her untamed spirit. She's sent away to school where her dear (and first) friend Helen Burns teaches her to stand bravely under reprimand - and to focus her courage.As Jane advances in school she becomes mellowed - but still the passion broods beneath. The story carries into her young adulthood when she becomes a teacher (at the same school where she grew up) and determines to see what there is in life beyond teaching and solitude and walls. So the orphan woman-child advertises for a governess position and is quickly hired at the home of the restless and gruff Edward Rochester - a man who finds Jane's controlled attitude, her level stare, her unfailing honesty and scathing intelligence enchanting. As their love develops, Jane realizes a secret about Edward that cannot be loved away, and she tears herself bodily from him, a terrified, frightened, heartbroken girl-woman once again homeless.I've no wish to spoil it for those who haven't read it, but suffice it to say, this fourth classic in all that I have read in my life surely inspires me to read more of its kind! I had no idea a Victorian woman would create a story with such passion. I feel moved to write, moved to create, and at a level with Bront that far exceeds death or time. She is a writer, a fervent spirit, and I stand here, nearly two centuries after her death, feeling shoulder-to-shoulder with her. She gives that much of herself to the work. I cried both at the last segment where she is a child, and the end of the novel itself (something I can't recall ever doing while reading.)Having read formula fiction all my life, I'm in particular impressed with Bront's power of description.Bront breaks norm often by flipping to the present tense, creating a quickness of spirit that contrasts remarkably with the more doleful passages. I find her writing comfortable - for want of a better word. Reading her tale was a pleasure - at times deep with wisdom, at times amusing with spirit, at times very doleful. She tours the human plane of emotion, twisting the plot quite more feverishly than I'd anticipated. Several times I sat forward in astonishment as the plot twisted and volted.So much symbolism in this novel, and captured so beautifully, like a still life - the virgin moon, the burning, lustful fires that destroy, fade out, then flicker anew atop candles before a fading portrait of love beautified as the novel draws to a close. In particular I'm struck by the irony in the way Jane and Mr. Rochester meet - and the way the story closes.I fell in love with Rochester quickly - I don't know why. He is rude, arrogant, and self-interested. Yet his changeable (nearly childlike) spirit - and his admiration for all that is reprehensible in Jane to everyone else - captured my heart.Bront writes both as a Romantic and a Victorian - challenging the church, female diffidence, and `the norm' - and presenting her prose as richly as a woman in love and as candidly as a man of her generation before the court. A writer caught between worlds--and isn't that the richest place to be as a writer?5 out of 5 stars for Jane Eyre. I gave to Bront sleepless nights - and that's no embellishment.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Gut wrenching victorian novel,"I picked up a copy of Jane Eyre at a used book store. I have a collection of old books. I buy them for the age and cover art and then read them. I've heard of Jane Eyre, but have never read it. Its an amazing book. I read it in two days and have been thinking about it every day for the last three weeks.Reading other people's reviews is interesting, but if I hear it's a ""woman power"" feminist book one more time I'm going to scream! I'm sorry, I think it's way more advanced and classy than the tired old 1960s woman's movement stuff. If Jane Eyre was a modern feminist, she'd be spending her time trying to knock Mr.Rochester out!If you enjoy Jane Eyre, you should also read 'First Violin' and 'Forever Amber'. They aren't well known, but feature similar gut-wrenching romance.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My favorite novel of all time,"I always tell people: ""ask any girl if they liked Jane Eyre. The answer is sure to be a yes."" The story has been outlined through many forms of media, including the stage and the silverscreen. But the experience of reading Bronte's exquisitely detailed, and passionate writing is to be found on the pages.The sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the pan-ultimate Byronic hero, is exciting, and Jane's growth as a woman is relational to her position with Mr. Rochester.The gem of the story is its subversiveness, however. Bronte was audacious in Jane's defiance of religious and aristocratic authorities, challenging the traditions that defined British society.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Most deservedly a classic, but curiously modern.","I read this book on a sort of whim, because I'd been harboring a copy about a hundred years old (cloth cover, and kind of cool in it's own right), and because I had just read 'The Eyre Affair' by Jasper Fforde. In his story, the plot for Jane Eyre gets 're-written' to have a 'newer and more popular ending'. While Jasper Fforde is as loopy as Douglas Adams, that is another review. He seizes on something great though, which is the last section of the book where Jane has gone off from Rochester, and (under terrible pressure) is next to assenting to go off to India with her cousin to work herself to death and bear his children. In the Fforde story, that is how Jayne Eyre ends, until his heroine Thursday Next comes in and sets things on a different path. But enough of that. It's worth mentioning that I was intrigued by the glimpse I got of the story from a single remove. I am very glad I was compelled to read it. I found Jane Eyre very enjoyable, and as I mentioned very modern in many of it's features, from plot movement,to the confidential nature of the narrator's speech, to a certain darker caste, which, while gothic certainly, is also the color of the paper that nearly every screenplay and t.v. script is written on today. The rush & dash of the romance is first rate, and I am sure it was ground breaking when it was written. I look forward to reading a morsel more from each of the Bell (Eyre) sisters.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Deserves to be the classic that it is,"I first read Jane Eyre in 8th grade and re-read it this month as I turned 40.

This was a reminder that the quality of thought and writing of the classics of English and American literature is far superior to so much of what gets churned out today.

Clean type, wide margins easily read, they chose to make the book slightly wider than thicker so it is comfy to hold.Entering the world of the immortal emotion in a setting long past, not being a scholar, does pose problems.Penguin provides valuable auxilliary notes explaining the context quite well.For instance,I had not known that Thackery was struggling with publishing then and that C.B. was taking solace and courage from his battles.Do other publishings of the classics:Norton,Dover, Bantam, etc. relate to the public as well?I whish my fellow customers or Amazon in its info blurb were more sensitive to how the book they review is made,and how the text is supported.",positive

Love and Passion, Hate and disdain, desire and greed, deception and mystery, etc. abound in this book. Bronte is a genius, and it shows in this book!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A classic for all,"It's true this book, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, is extremely boring for the first fifty to seventy pages, but the plot line needs that much set up because it is so difficult. Once one has made it past those pages, hold on for the ride of a lifetime because it is a complicated and complete novel. Charlotte Bront&egrave; is an extremely effective writer. Her explicit detail is apparent after the first page. She carries this aspect of writing throughout the novel in describing both her surroundings and the people she meets. Because of her writing style, one learns more about the characters in this novel than in most modern novels, this enhances the enjoyment and knowledge gained from this book. The detail used in this novel helps make it easier to relate to the main character Jane Eyre. Since this book is written in the first person, it is very important that one is able to connect with the main character who is also the narrator.This novel's plot is so complex that one almost never wants to put it down after those first fifty pages. The setup, though boring, is completely necessary to the rest of the novel and the rest of the plot. The most important parts of the plot are often right after a slow spot in the book. I believe this is just to emphasis these points. Included in a way such as that is the portion near the beginning where Jane stands up to her aunt who she is living with. This part is the beginning of Jane's strong headed and straightforward attitude, which was very uncharacteristic of a woman at the time this novel was written.Also, the time at Lowood Academy when Jane's friend Helen dies of consumption is one of the points in which the novel starts to slow down and an important item is introduced. Jane goes through many changes in atmosphere throughout the novel, some by choice, some not. This gives us more opportunity to relate to her because throughout our lives we all will have to deal with changes in location, surroundings, and relationships. The ways in which Jane reacts to her changes will in one way or another affect us for the rest of our lives. The plot has many different places where it is so entangled both by Jane's feelings and the actions of the other characters. This is to represent the times in our lives where things seem complicated.It is easy to relate to the main character, Jane Eyre, which makes it a good novel to represent our life and take advice from. This is a classic because it has survived the trials and tribulations of time and is still considered an excellent book to take advice from and to learn about what has happened in the live of people of the past. Each of us can step into Jane's shoes at one point or another and see things as she sees them. It makes one feel connected to the novel and understand what is going on much better than a novel which does not have the first person interpretation and emotions in it. Because the narrator is a young girl growing up it is harder for males, such as me, to relate to portions of the novel, though it is just as easy to relate to other portions. Also, because of the difference in time periods, it is harder to relate to exact problems, though the problems can be generalized so as to be more relevant.Overall, this novel is a great work in which many people can receive hours of enjoyment and thought. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is thought to be ""mature"" enough to read it with full comprehension because it is a novel that has bearing on many issues both of the mind and of the world.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"A beautiful, moving book that has withstood the test of time","I read this book in 7th grade and liked it. Two years later, we read it again in English, and I liked it even more.This book portrays it's main character as a strong, outspoken, smart and independent woman, written in a time when it was unconventional to do so. While the book is over 100 years old, it is not outdated because it's message is something that people can relate to today.Because it is wordy and not exactly fast, easy reading, some people disregard the book as being boring. However, if you give it a chance, you will probably find that it is suspenseful and exciting.There are many surprises. Just when you think that something is going to happen, some strange twist of fate changes the course of the story. It's also mysteroius and even funny.Ultimately the book has a positive message. Jane is an incredibly strong character who shows what it means to be true to yourself.Many people have to read this book, whether they want to or not. Other people choose to read it. Even if you don't want to read it, appreciate the writing style and open your mind to it. You might like it. I do.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Masterpiece that Transends Generations,"Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Exciting and enjoyable,"I read this book a couple of months ago and really enjoyed it. It is about a girl who is adopted by her evil aunt and is sent away to boarding school, there she becomes a teacher. Later she becomes a governess and falls in love with her employer. I won't say what happens next- it will spoil the suprise. all I can say is I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although in some places I found the language difficult to understand. Don't let me put you off.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,CANONIZATION AND ITS EFFECTS,"About a year ago, my book group read, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; Jean Rhys' 'pre-quel' to &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; In book group, we are frequently forced to give notice to the fact that a book varies with the age of the reader and that there are childhood books that belong to childhood while there are other books that grow with you throughout your life. With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to REread Jane Eyre. About half way through the book, I realized that I had never read it before: this was my first read! Interestingly, the woman who led the discussion on Wide Sargasso Sea had the identical experience. So did another. We decided that it was more than the movie in which the still only babyfat Orson Welles wished himself to be the romantic hero: Jane Eyre was so much a part of Western Culture that without actually having read the book, we knew it. Charlotte Bronte, writing at the very beginning of the 19th century, was a much better writer than many who followed her. George Sand's writing is more pretentious and more closely tied to the 18th century. While &quot;Little Women&quot; is a wonderful book to revisit, Louisa May Alcott's potboilers are tiresome. I can not get into Dickens or James Fenimore Cooper. Until you come upon writers who bridge the gap between the 19th and 20th centuries -- Edith Wharton springs to mind -- no one is quite as readable as Charlotte, unless it is one of her sisters.That is not to say that the plot holds up. It is riddled with co-incidence that nearly undermines Bronte's intentions. However, her characters live and have dimension, even if their circumstances do not. So often, the infamous &quot;canon&quot; is criticized as being full of dead white European males. Charlotte is a woman whose work has shaped our thoughts and influenced us for nearly 200 years. I would say that Charlotte Bronte is part of the Western canon.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Splendid,"I have read this book over and over! It is a wonderful novel on the human condition. It gives hope to any who desires to rise above thier station in life. Bronte does a wonderful job depicting each and every one of her characters. The happy ending though somewhat unrealistic is very heart felt. It makes me want to be a better, smarter, more pure person each time I read it. I strongly recommend this to everyone. It keeps your attention and is always an inspiration.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,True Romance,"I had to read this for a class and expected to have to force myself through it. Surprise! It was really enjoyable and I breezed through the finish weeks before my classmates. I don't know much about contemporary romance novels but having read a couple Austen novels for previous classes, I can say I prefer Bronte and look forward to trying some of the other novels from the Bronte sisters. I like the 'ugly ducklings in love' storyline between Jane and Rochester and it kept me intrigued but I was even more pleased with Bronte's accessible prose. Recommended.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Gothic and Brilliant,"There is a reason this book has remained popular over the last 160 years. It is a dynamic novel written by Bronte who grew up in the isolated Moors of England in the Victorian Era which is used for the backdrop of this seemingly, at first, romantic story. However, as the events unfold, the novel reveals itself to be a gothic story filled with terror, intrigue, and true love. I recommend this book to everyone from age 7 to 70. A must read.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will."" - Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre","Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romance novel which was written over 170 years ago, in 1847, is deservingly a classic of English literature. ""Jane Eyre"" has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words, ""This book is amazing"" and so it was. I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its language is beautiful - refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh. The dialogs and descriptions are memorable and visual. Above all, the novel introduces us to two main characters, a young orphan- pale, thin, ""almost un-earthy"" but determined, strong-willed, kind and reasonable Jane and Mr. Edward Rochester - sardonic, powerful, passionate, and tormented master of Thornfield. The story of their impossible love has attracted millions of readers not only in the English speaking countries but all over the world. ""Jane Eyre"" has been adapted to TV and big screen 18 times. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Samantha Morton, Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, have played the couple that had to overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years.",positive

Not to mention, the story of Jane Eyre, which is classic and easy to read. I really enjoy the drawings by Dame Darcy. I also like the cover's design; it is actually the photograph of an antique book.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An all-time favorite,"Whenever anyone asks me what my all-time favorite book is, this is the one I tell them. And it's true. I started reading it once when I was younger, but I wasn't quite ready for it yet and I couldn't get past the first chapter. When I picked it up again a couple of years later, I fell for it. I remember hating Mrs. Reed and her children - especially John - with such a passion, I wished I could reach through the book and wring their necks until they gained some sense. Mr. Brocklehurst, too. And being terrified when she was stuck in the red room. I've reread it at least five times since then, and it always seems that I come across a scene or a character that I've forgotten about in the year or two since I read it last. In college, I wrote a paper on it and came across interpretations that I'd never even began to consider, prompting careful rereading of most of the chapters once again. I think it was the first real ""literary"" book I read as a kid, and possibly the first book that made me feel so strongly for the characters (whether it was hate or love) - that just may be why nothing has been able to replace it as my favorite.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Haunting Classic,"one of my favorite books from the long list of the ol' required high school reading. I fell in love with Jane immediately, though it took a while for me to appreciate the novel on a whole. I came back to the novel again in more recent years, and I have enjoyed it more and more with each read. Having heard it as a book on tape while on bedrest brought the story to life even more and made the mysterious Bertha and the dark and moody Mr. Rochester that much more intense. This is so much more than a romantic tale between an unfortunate governess and her brooding employer; it is truly the story of a young woman coming into her own.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My favorite piece of literature,"How can I put into words how much I love this book? I read it for the first time when I was 12, and at 26, it still has the power to stir me as it once did. It has everything one could possibly want in a book. Romance, lust, horrid relatives, a brooding hero, near-death experiences, and to top it off, a mad woman in the attic. I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Heroine I Could Relate To,"Let's get one thing straight..I LOATHE romance novels. My Grandmother reads hundreds of those Fabio-plastered, heaving cleavage covered paperbacks...but NOT ME. Don't get me wrong, I loved Gone with the Wind...but as I explored a few more of the more classic romances ie..Emma, Wuthering Heights, or Sense and Sensibility..I found the movies much more appealing. Then along comes Jane Eyre. She is not buxom and airheaded and dashingly beautiful. She is plain, modest, and smart...That's right! a more modern woman!! Jane does not faint at the sight of a handsome man, nor does she swoon over expensive clothes....Let me tell you a little more about Jane Eyre..... As a child, Jane was left an orphan with her brutal aunt and cousins. Treated unfairly and taunted buy the other children she soon developed a quick-witted tongue. After receiving an honest verbal lashing from Jane, her aunt packed her few belongings and pretty much &quot;shipped&quot; the young girl off to a dreadful and gloomy school called &quot;Lowood&quot;. At Lowood, Jane quickly learned to bite her tongue through strict discipline from the Headmaster.(Lowood often reminds me of the discplinary school David Copperfield received some beatings in.) Here at school Jane is educated and cared for but never loved. She stays on at Lowood to become a teacher herself, but soon finds a position in a far away town to be a private counsel and teacher to a young girl Adele. Adele is the young French, beautiful and very spoiled ward to a great man known as Mr. Rochester. Jane soon learns that Mr. Rochester is very mysterious and aloof ..he often leaves her and Adele alone for months at a time on business travel. When he is at home Jane finds herself drawn to him, his strange conversation style and his knowledge of good books. He is by no means a HANDSOME man but attracts a great deal of attention because of his financial means. I Loved this book for many reasons. I loved the contrast between Jane and Adele...Adele is spoiled, loved and beautiful....Jane the opposite. And the MYSTERIES! Where does Mr. Rochester go? WHO is Adele? Why are there screams late in the darkness of the manor? Who could it be? And the best mystery of all? What will become of Mr. Rochester and Jane? Romance? Jane never OUTWARDLY desires to be a distinguished lady like the beautiful women Mr. Rochester frequently entertaines. But as a reader you feel she deserves such a posion. You will find yourself page tuning faster and faster as you secretly wish for modest Jane Eyre to succeed and and achieve status and the love she deserves.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A classic definitely worth reading,"I recently saw the Broadway musical of Jane Eyre and was inspired to read the book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Jane seems so real as a character that I wish I could meet her. What an amazing heroine! The reader roots for her success all through the book. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is one of the best in all of literature. In high school the classics I had to read were usually so dull (including Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte) that I tend to stear clear of classics now, even though I am a voracious reader, but Jane Eyre is so fast paced that it hardly seems like a classic. I couldn't put it down! Don't read this story because its touted as being about female empowermant and don't avoid it for the same reason. Wether you are male or female, read this book, because it is a great story with great characters you will remember for a lifetime!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Darker Side of Nineteenth Century England,"Contrary to the MGM film of the 40's, this book does not begin with, ""My name is Jane Eyre..."" Instead, we get an opening chapter about a little girl who is cruelly treated by an abominable family, and her attempts to stay afloat. The Jane Eyre of the novel is a spirited young woman, who yearns to be able to experience life despite the limitations society has placed upon women. This book is a wonderful read. Bronte's 19th century England is not the neo-classical world of manners and balls that permeate Jane Austin's universe; rather, the world of Jane Eyre one of ragged romanticism that plays out against the harsh elements, and the world seems as primitive indoors as it does outside. Bronte writes in a very lucid, revelatory style, and the first person narrative does a lot to help draw you into this story. Even if you know the secret in the attic, there is so much more about this novel that you may not know about.The biggest surprise about this novel once I read it was that Jane's story does not end with the revelation of Rochester's dark gothic secret (even though this was written several years after Austen's Northanger Abbey, it's fun to read the two books in conjunction). I am surprised that most film and stage versions of this novel rarely include the important last third of the book. But I'll let you discover the developments to Jane's character on your own. The ending is a tear-jerker (but in a great way). This is definitely the book to read on the front porch of a summer cottage, or in front of a fire on a winter night. Mystery, romance, intrigue, religion, and feminism... it's all in here. And it's worth the read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,254 other reviews before this? Man! You've got stamina!,"This was the best book I have ever read and I cried when it was over. I wish Charlotte Bronte had written more books.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Very well written, and realistic.","I am 14 years old, and I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it first four years ago and was particularly impressed with the quality of the writing and the ideas displayed. Charlotte Bronte very cleverly used her book as an outlet for her own feelings and experiences as a woman which, in her day, were not considered or acknowledged. Unfortunately, while reading some of the other reviews on this page and elsewhere, I have noticed that some people are still discriminatory and insensitive towards female writers and believe that their views can simply be dismissed as soppy and foolish. I do not think that this is right. The fact that a person can write about his or her life using such great detail and keeping such an objective view of it as Charlotte Bronte did should not be dismissed as monotonous or boring, but rather should be acknowledged as a talent and as a result of hard work. It also shows that it cannot be easy to analyse your own life in such a way that you can understand and write about every detail of it. Charlotte Bronte's writing of Jane Eyre reflects her own character; that she wanted, like Jane, to be independent and go out into the world, and I think that it is this element of independence in many women that defies the assumed 'authority' and 'superiority' of the opposite gender and therefore they resent feminists speaking out. All in all, I think that Jane Eyre is an excellent novel and that it should not be labelled as some foolish, whimsical piece of writing that is only respected because it was written more than a century ago. The quality and status of a book and its author should not be undermined by the period of time in which it was written.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I enjoyed this so much more the second time around,"It's always good to take time to reread those required books from school once you've obtained some years and maturity. This is a lovely and somewhat autobiographical tale of Jane Eyre, orphaned and raised by self-centered and uncaring relatives until they send her off to school. Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read isSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them. Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A good book,"I admit, it took me about 2 weeks to read this book, but it was good. Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense.The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever.But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect?I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Reality Jane,"We were forced to read Jane Eyre in high school. My teacher was so derisive of Jane and the choices she made that I was turned off.I reread this in my 20's and OMG, what I missed! This book is the Victorian equivalent of a Jerry Springer episode.Jane goes through hell and high water, and like most humans makes a couple of bad choices and mistakes but I kid you not, if someone was telling me this story now, I would have thought they got it off Oprah, Springer, or Dr. Phil.If you can get past the old fashioned language and Jane's habit of taking the long way around explaining things, you'll love this book.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,1.0,How is the average review so high????,"Based on the fact that the average review is 4.5 stars, I'm going to assume that most of the reviewers have been women. That said, I think I'll offer a different perspective than the rest of the reviewers. That perspective is that this book is one of the most boring, bland, lifetime-ish wastes of paper known to (wo)man. To give an example of what I mean, it takes 3 CHAPTERS to lead up to the failed wedding! The author goes into great detail describing every little minute insignificant meaningless thing that happens (such as a chapter for her to say she didn't want Rochester's gifts)-and it takes her 20 frickin pages to say that she's leaving a guy. Somehow, this got to be considered a literary classic about feminine empowerment. Just don't complain about guys liking stuff like Die Hard and football games and not being in touch with their feminine side after having to read [stuff] like this in English class.",negative

It was extremely difficult to get through the book because not only was the plot an absolute bore, the characters also contributed to that boredom.After reading the book twice, trying to comprehend what was the point of the story, I still have yet to understand why Charlotte Bront even bothered writing this book. From what I can interpret, Jane Eyre is a girl who is lonely and dejected but finds love in a man called Mr. Rochester. Everything that happened in the middle is not significant. The story is extremely boring because it is too sentimental, too dull (just like Jane Eyre), and too long for a story with that plot line. What the characters say or do have no lasting effect in the reader's memory- it just blows right by. The characters are basic and have superficial, unoriginal motives. They do not do anything exciting or significant to help add to the plot. I kept skipping pages or rereading the same stuff because each and every page seems identical content-wise. The entire book has absolutely no memorable moments, proving how insignificant the work of literature truly is.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Definitely Not What I Expected: Jane Eyre,"Definitely Not What I Expected: Jane EyreJane Eyre is a novel set in 1800's England. It is about a young girl, Jane, who wants to escape her horrible life with her aunt and abusive cousins. Her parents died when she was a little girl. She wants to go to school and eventually teach. Jane is a smart girl who loves to read, but is not very fond of her appearance. Jane Eyre tells the tale of a woman's experiences in life, about men, friendship, and hardship. When taking a job as a governess, Jane stumbles upon a love she did not intend, and a mystery she's determined to solve.Although Jane Eyre is not exactly my cup of tea there were some positive points to the book. The character Jane Eyre is a very good role model for young women. She is not some stunningly gorgeous princess in a castle, she's very real in the sense that she has insecurities like everyone else. She may struggle with her appearance, but she is very smart and articulate, and does not rely on men to take care of her. She's very independent and uses her brains, not her looks to get what she wants. Appearance is something almost every adolescent girl has struggled with, despite what time period they've grown up in. Jane Eyre presents a positive message to girls.Unfortunately, the rest of the novel was not quite as inspiring. In general, I found Jane Eyre to be very dull and boring, and far too long. The literature style was very bland. When reading Jane Eyre the voice in my head became monotonous, I was ready to fall asleep! With so much detail when describing the characters or setting, it seems like it takes Charlotte Bronte two or three pages just to describe a chair.Extremely long and boring at times, Jane Eyre captures the time period well, almost too well with the amount of detailed description on every page. The character Jane is very interesting, complex, and well-written, but she needs a different author to put her into a better story.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Definetly one of the best romance novels!,"These days there are a lot of these 'trashy' romance novels being published. But the ovels written by Jane Austen, The Brontes(Charlotte, Ann &amp; Emily),Georgette Heyer (all are English)have nothing trashy in them. They're so good that I wish that I was there in England during the 16th &amp; 17th century. Jane Eyre was one of my all-time favourites, thoough I didn't realise it back then when I 1st read it. I had the misfortune of reading the abridged version &amp; I'm sure many of the beautiful English phrases would've been deleted. I don't really remember the whole story in detail, but I do recall a brief outline. It's about a lady Jane Eyre, who falls in love with Mr.Rochester(I THINK he's her employer, I'm not really sure) But later, it's revealed that Mr. Rochester has a wife, who is also mentally deranged. I really don't remember what happens in the end, but I DO remember one thing. At the beginning, when the novel unfolds, I thought it was kind of scary. There were these wierd sounds coming from above, but later it was all explained.(I won't tell u how. You've got 2 read it &amp; find out!)

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Love Almost Lost,"Jane was orphaned as a baby and thrust upon her widowed aunt, to raise alongside her own three children. Her aunt, resentful of Jane and distrustful of such a quiet and sad child, makes her life miserable. When Jane is ten and the opportunity for her to go away to boarding school arises, she jumps at the chance. Aside from not being constantly harassed by her aunt and cousins, things are not much better at school, at first. The teachers are strict, uniforms are painfully plain, food is scarce and sometimes inedible. However, Jane feels at peace with her life there, even staying on to teach when she is too old to be a student.When Jane is eighteen, her dear friend and former teacher leaves school to marry. Jane decides it is time for a change in her own life. She advertises herself out as a private tutor, and is soon hired to be the governess and teacher for young Adele, a little French girl under the guardianship of Mr. Rochester, who lives in a grand English manor.Mr. Rochester is moody; he is more often grouchy and irritable than pleasant. He insults Jane, and seems surprised and charmed when she returns his barbs without taking offense. Jane begins to dare to hope for a relationship to develop between them. But Mr. Rochester is a society man. He is wealthy, and he surrounds himself with other wealthy folks, including some very eligible young ladies who look down on Jane. Furthermore, Jane can't be certain Mr. Rochester is always truthful with her. Something very strange is going on at Mr. Rochester's manor, something certain to shock Jane.I liked the fact that the protagonists of this story are not beautiful people. Jane is small, thin and plain. Mr. Rochester is often described as ugly, and certainly fierce. It's nice to read a love story about people who are more normal than the usual cast of characters in a romance. I also liked Jane's resolve in staying true to herself. She is confident in who she is and even her love can't make her betray her morals. However, despite her decision to become independent, she still knows that Mr. Rochester has a claim on her heart, and she isn't ashamed of that fact.The weakness of this story is simply that of time and style. It was written in the 1800s, when writers had a tendency to focus on description and long dialog, sometimes at the expense of action. As a result, there are parts of this book that are tedious and require skimming in order to get to the good stuff.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,NOT EXACTLY AIRPLANE READING,"Charlotte Bronte beautifully constructs each sentence in ""Jane Eyre"" with an exacting precision that is at once dated and elegant.While the story can be a bit overwrought in almost a parody like way--it hasn't aged especially well--all of that is a minor distraction to enjoying the exquisite craftsmanship with which Bronte writes.Bronte is as much an architect as a storyteller--every sentence and event ties to an often unexpected event or occurance later in the book. She doesn't just churn out prose in the assembly-line fashion of hacks Janet Evanovich or Stephen King. When you read Bronte, you understand what is meant by ""classic."" She is the difference between junk food (Evanovich/King) and a gourmet meal.This isn't airplane reading and you won't breeze through it in days. It's the sort of book you savor for 20 or 30 pages and perhaps return to a week later.And if you are not a student who resents it as ""required reading,"" you'll truly thank yourself for voluntarily finishing a book of such style and class.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,"Maybe it's just me, but...","I found the beginning of this book interesting enough, but in my opinion it just went down from there. Unlike the other people who have reviewed this book, I believe that Jane Eyre could have been reduced to half its size. The plot was good, but it was a struggle to finally finish the book. I know, many who have read this might hate me, but I just found the it rather uninteresting. Or maybe I just can't appreciate good books, either one. I wouldn't recommend this.",negative

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Classic Gothic Novel,"I read this book as a teenager over 50 years ago and loved it. I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Charlotte Bronte Unsurpassed,"It's easy to see why this novel is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic for a reason!,"Many people consider Jane Eyre to be Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece (with a minority preferring Villette). I have to agree- Jane Eyre is my number one of her novels, by far.We all know the story by this point. A governess falls in love with her employer to find out he has a dark secret...dun dun dun! It's very much a Romantic as well as romantic novel. It's very different from anything Jane Austen ever wrote, that's for sure! (Charlotte was not a fan of dear Jane, by the way).The first time I read this book, as a freshman in high school, I didn't get into it until after Jane got to Thornfield. I found the parts with Jane as a child draggy. Now I get sucked into the story right from the beginning. Young Jane is a fiery, passionate creature who's not afraid to speak her mind. Lowood makes her take on a more controlled, reserved front but she never loses her inner passions. I find Jane so strong and still a realistic character- I just love her.It's not a totally perfect book but it's close. It's only little nitpicks that bug me- like all the coincidences. Rochester isn't exactly my favorite character but I totally get the connection and the love between them and on a literary level I do like him. On a personal level, I don't- but it works in a book. I appreciate how he has to suffer for his sins and really has to earn his happy ending.",positive

Anyone who has ever read it should be able to clearly notice it's underlying message about redemption and second chances. I personally love that Jane is not some beautiful, perfect heroine, but is flawed and considered &#34;plain&#34; by her peers. Her personality and attitude are what entices Mr. Rochester to fall in love with her, not what she looks like. Their love overcomes so many obstacles, it's ridiculous. I was forever changed by this book. Probably why my standard for a man was raised so high...lol! Anyway, read it! You'll love it!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"Sometimes we wonder just how little things have actually changed since that time. Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my Favorite books!,I love the Bronte sisters. You cant beat the price of these free books either.

Books tell you so much more than movies or TV shows can. I wasn't disappointed. The plot became clear, and the lessons taught in this story were timeless. How does a person come to have faith, when his past has been anything but perfect? How can we endure, when we have bad experience after bad experience? When &#34;bad&#34; things happen, that is when our character is developed, and this story shows that over and over.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"I am Jane Eyre, sir","It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie.

The main character is not like any other heroine which I can think of. She was not beautiful like most, nor extremely cunning. Somehow Bronte manages to develop her personality perfectly, and gets you to like this Jane Eyre, though she is probably the only one in the story who you will like. Bronte makes all of the other characters extremely one sided in their personalities, all dominated by a fatal flaw of some type (the domineering spirit of Mr. Rochester, the extreme sacrafice of emotion by Saint John, the extreme simplicity of Mrs. Fairfax, etc.) This was both good (in that it helps one to see that nearly any character trait can be taken too far and become bad) and bad (the characters were rather stiff somehow).The only other complaint that I have is that it was a bit long and drawn out. Somehow it should have been about 50 pages shorter, though I am not quite sure where the 50 pages should be cut from. It seemed almost like too little butter scraped over too much bread.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,a deep and profound love story,"In British literature, my favorite writers are Bronte sisters.Bronte sisters are the genius that their names were known to by a few novels in the world.The heroine Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bronte's novel was brought up by a mean aunt.Therefore Jane Eyre received terrible bullying.The problem of the bullying becomes the great problem in Japan now.In a school a few children sometimes are bullied, and to my surprise, a few parents in Japan abuse their children.The first scene of Jane Eyre is her unhappy life's departureI watch deep depth of human existence there.That chief director who took care of Jane Eyre must be crazy , if we consider by modern sense.It is odd that he is a Christian .Because Christ taught love and impressed the human. And Christ taught us that we are the light of the world.Helen is a kind friend of Jane Eyre in the school and has the heart like the angel.That chief director did the evil that he lets weak Helen walk in the rain .Thus, Helen dies.Furthermore, everywhere in the novel, a British beautiful rural scenery is pictured with the fresh and young sensitivity of a young woman .The mansion which she visited as a tutor is right attractive like an old cave.A big mansion has a secret.A thing that suggests a modern horror novel drifts.Gradually young Jane Eyre is charmed by middle-aged Rochester with the naivete such as the wild beast.This description will be a example of the love story's masterpiece .There are ""The sorrow of young Werther"", French ""The lily of the valley"", Russian ""Anna Karenina"" in the world love stories.But in their novels ,three women are the noble or the rich.In that respect, Jane Eye is from the misfortune.I am interested by the existent problem that this human being is born.Jane Eyre gets true love by power of her intention in the misfortune.It is not at all a light novel.On the contrary, it is a heavy novel.I read Jane Eyre and remembered ""Light in August"" of Faulkner.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A classic in a perfect device,"I first read JE in Spanish when I was 11 or 12 - my memory seldom serves me well. Years passed but JE didn't - have no idea how many times I read it! After some years of studying, I was able to read - and enjoy - Bronte in English. That was sublime! My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his ""best earthly companion"".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear. He did not know how to do things differently - out of love.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre is a wonderful classic novel!,"LOVED the book! Jane Eyre is an inspiring character -- a strong person unwilling to accept the mistreatment that came with the ""bad hand"" dealt her at infancy. She is determined and self-assured -- a woman far ahead of her time! Also loved reading it on my Kindle Fire! My favorite thing about reading on a Kindle Fire -- the link to the dictionary! Put your finger on a word, and you're taken to the word in the dictionary -- so convenient, especially when reading a classic novel written with some antiquated words! Wish I had the Kindle Fire while reading Jane Austen's novels a couple of years ago! I've already downloaded several more FREE classics from Amazon!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Excellent book,"This is a great book. The only complaint I have is I think because it's the kindle version, sometimes I feel like I'm missing things here and there. For example, they keep mentioning a place called ***Shire....But all I can see is ***Shire. Anyway, not sure if it's like that in the hardcopy book, haven't checked. But I'm sure it has something to do with it being an electronic version. But, LOVE THIS BOOK!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Classic for Young Women and Christians,"If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The classic I'm always happy to read,"I recently watched a film version of Wuthering Heights which, strangely enough, reminded me how much I love Jane Eyre. I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the ""classics,"" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic. If you like the book, also check out the movie version with Michael Fassbender and Mia (I'm not even going to attempt her last name)",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Heartbreaking gratification,"I rate this book excellent as this is wat I felt as I flittered along in its story line. They do not call this a ""classic treasure"" for nothing, let me say. As I finished the conclusion, I still wanted more.

The reader instantly likes Jane and empathy remains with her throughout the novel. you feel that it imperative that Jane eventually marries Rochester according to the reader and I found myself willing her not to be swept away by St. John Rivers.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An enduring &amp; endearing classic,"JANE EYRE is one of my favorite Victorian novels. The feistiness and lovableness of Jane has never faded for me, even after several readings. My favorite passages from the text are those when Jane leaves Rochester and ends up at Marsh End; and when she is &quot;called&quot; by Rochester from afar and flees to return to him. Charlotte Bronte's writing of these passages is raw with emotion and unforgettable. If you have not yet taken the time to read this outstanding piece of Victorian fiction, do so now. You won't regret it.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Not only enightening, but hugely entertaining!","Today's literary environment is filled with books that read like a bowl of popcorn--they are quickly devoured and lack any substance. However, I understand why many readers shy away from the classics. Most of the time, when I pick up a book I'm just looking to be entertained and diverted--I don't want to feel like I'm in my 12th grade English class. Don't despair if that's you: there are some classic novels that capture the best of both worlds. Jane Eyre is one of those books.Jane Eyre is filled with poetic and beautiful prose that will enlarge your vocabulary and stimulate your imagination. I especially enjoy the dialogue between Jane and Edward Rochester. Not only do the characters speak beautifully, but they also speak intelligently. There are many times a soliloquy will cut right to the heart of the matter in question with the precision of a scalpel, but with language that is poetic as it is accurate. It's a pity many modern novels can't achieve this same balance.Reading Jane Eyre is not like eating your literary vegetables. This book is hugely entertaining. It's gothic romance at its best. Edward Rochester is brooding, seductive, passionate and troubled--the quintessential bad boy. He is infinitely more compelling than that other Edward you'll find lingering around Forks. Jane is a tower of strength. She is a woman who falls deeply in love, but is not defined by that relationship. She does not find her identity in any man, but in the treasure of the spirit God gave her. She faces what would seem to most of us like unendurable suffering in the most admirable way--yet she doesn't come off as superhuman. This is the kind of character teenage girls should be reading--not the simpering, swooning Bella Swan.If you pick up this book, I promise you'll be entertained--but while you are entertained, you will also be uplifted.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A fresh experience,"I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.Oops! I've reviewed the audio book version available from Amazon's sister site Audible. Since I can't contribute to what's already been said about the original book, I'll leave this'wrong' review in place.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Liked it a little but didn't love it,"When I first picked a book for a school assignment. I had to read it. But when I got further into the book, it turned out to be an ok book to read. I didn't understand Jane's part very well. Why did she fall in love with an realy old man? You will have to read the book to figure this out.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,a heart-felt book with a beautiful ending!,I read Jane Eyre for an english class at UC irvine and i loved it! THe last scene with Jane and Rochester was a very touching and emotional scene that made my heart well-up.,positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Brilliant!!!,"This is my favorite book so far. Charlotte Bront was a splendid artist, she gave so much power to the story of the poor orphaned girl who grows to be a sensible, sensitive, self-concious, though passionate, young woman. A must-read!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Beautiful, yet there are some things that I didn't care for.","The way you become a friend of Jane's, follow her experiences, and see things from her point of view would make me give it five stars. Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, really gifted. Why, then, did I only give it four stars? This is because I grew sick and tired of the long, dull details towards the end of the book. I just wanted Jane to go away. I wanted it resolved, but quickly. I was becoming quickly agitated and annoyed. But still, as angered as I was towards the ending (by the way, I didn't care for the deal with the Rivers family at all), the beginning was so majestic I just couldn't insult it too much. I could feel Jane's pain so much. I even began saying, when I was notifying everyone I was going to go read it, that I was 'going to visit Jane.'",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,It was GREAT!!,"I had to read this book for a school assignment, and I actually ended up liking it. I couldn't put the book down when I first thought that the two might fall in love. I wanted so badly for him to ask her to marry him. I was heartbroken when I found out the truth about Mr. Rochester. Throughout the rest of the book, I kept hoping that somehow they would get back together. I almost cried at the end when Jane talks about Mr. Rochester seeing his first born. I loved this book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A passionate story that grabs your heart.,Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read. It is a story woven in perfect harmony holding a daring and almost forbidden romance. A romance that surpasses all boudries and definitions and paints unexplanable love before our eyes. Those who read this book will be forever changed. Jane Eyre is in us all and so is the dream of a true and boudless love.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Once I picked it up I simply COULDN'T put it down!!,"When I first picked up the book for a school assignment, I felt overwhelmed b/c of the length and extensive vocabulary...but then I really got into it! Every time I thought that things were calming down, there was another new and surprisingly unexpected twist!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A must read for any woman wanting to hear her own voice.,"I read Jane Eyre once in high school, once in college and just now, five years later. It is a wonderful example of a book that can be read over and over again and with each reading comes a new experience. Charlotte Bronte tells a formidible tale of one woman's intellect and passions which break across &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;caste,&quot; to use Bronte's own words. Bronte wonderfully describes the inner voice of Jane which Jane instinctually values from a young age. It leads her to take extraordinary emotional risks. She does not allow herself to be shamed into behavior, nor does she shy away from her own desires and ideas. This is a book for ANY person, male or female of any color who likes a great mystery and a profound tale of human strength and experience",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Better for the older people,"This book has a very long, slow beginging but once you get into it, it gets interesting. In my opinion, you should just rent the movie. It goes a lot faster and you can understand it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Realistic Adventure,"This book was a wonderful, well written novel. This adventure of Jane Eyre is all the more enjoyable because it is plausible. Despite the very Christian views of the characters, and my stance of being unaffiliated there are few books I have enjoyed as much as this, and few fictional characters I respect more.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,Loved this book!!! Enjoyed everything about it. I think it was well written and held my attention. Very good book,positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Good But Difficult,"A classic, I know, and good story line, but very difficult to read - thanks to my Kindle, between the dictionary and translations, I was able to look up words or phrases on just about every page - made for very slow reading - but was still interesting enough to stick with it, even though it was probably the longest book I've ever read!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,More than just a love story,"To get right to the point, this book is one that every girl needs to read. Jane never forgets or loses who she is no matter what she goes through. And in the end, not even her wildest dreams could compare to what became her reality and it's all because she stayed true to herself. Jane Eyre, in all her bravery, quickly and easily became my most beloved heroine. She never tried to change Mr. Rochester into something he wasn't. She wouldn't allow him to spoil her with superficial things. She didn't want anything his money could buy, she just wanted to be needed, to be loved. And in the end, that was all Mr. Rochester wanted as well. What more could you ask for? Charlotte Bronte worked wonders. She made Jane feel as if she is an old friend telling her life story through laughter and tears. Reading this book will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. I guarantee it. Disney princesses can suck it. Jane takes the crown.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A step into the past,The reader can understand more of the past through the eyes of Jane Eyre. Her experiences are from a different era.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Do not Eyre on the side of caution,"My first attempt at a popular classic of that period, and I must admit, that I started to read it with some apprehension. I was worried that I would find it too daunting - how wrong I was! At one point in the book, Jane enters into the Billiards Room in Thornfield Hall to speak to Mr Rochester, I was there too. I smelt the musty, stale pipe smoke, observed the dimly lit room, and heard the russle of the ladies starched skirts.For my first attempt at such a novel, I wasn't let down, in fact I was disappointed when the book ended, wanting to stay in the life of Jane Eyre. It now makes me want to read more of Charlotte Bronte's work!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,YAY!,"This book was SO wonderful! I was unsure about it at first because just the size of it intimidated me, but it had so many good values in it, and such a wonderful plot that just drew you in from the beginning. I would reccomend this book to anyone! I happen to be a big fan of romance, and this definately satisfied me romantically. The relationship that forms in this book is beautiful, and something I shall strive for in my own life.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A MUST Read!,"I adore this book. I read on a whim, it was one of the books in my bookshelf that I had not yet read, so I took it down and started to read. Within a few minutes I was so wrapped up in this novel that I did not leave my bedroom for 3 hours. Jane Eyre was a terrific tale of romance and bad luck. I have read it countless of times now, and every single time I have cried. I would definately reccommend this book to anyone! Please, please, please read! You will not regret it, I swear!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,surprisingly enjoyable..,"I had steered clear from Jane Eyre because I had imagined it was some frivilous Victorian-era romance novel, suitable only to junior high school girls. Well I'm glad I invested the time to prove that was wrong!Jane Eyre is, ultimately, a story of human values and the serious choices in life we all must make from time to time. While not an especially plausible story, it is moving and thought-provoking. I certainly think it would make for required reading for all teenagers; it delivers an excellent message (IMHO) contrary to what seems an obsession of young(er) people of money, good-looks, and &quot;independence at all costs&quot;.As a slight demerit, Jane Eyre isn't the best written novel. Some of the characterizations are weak, and the novel lacks the powerful prose of the works from George Eliott. And the story is a bit wobbly in the beginning. But put all this aside and enjoy.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane ..you are brave,"Jane was such a brave woman throughout her misfortunes .She began as a womanly child, professing to ignore her troubles and trying to love life for its worth .She deserved LOVE.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Favorite,"I read this book during my senior year in high school, and I loved it. I read it once a year, and I also have the movie. This is a very captivating book. The descriptions are very vivid and full of life. The love that grew between Jane and Edward survived many hardships, and their romance is one to dream about. Even though the book was written long ago, it still fits in with modern life. It is very easy to lose yourself in this wonderfully written book. This is a book that I think everyone should read. I know I plan to reread it many times during the course of my life.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,This is a wonderful book!,"I read the book Jane Eyre once when I was in 5th or 6th grade (or possible the summer in-between...?) and I absolutely LOVED it. I read it again the summer after seventh grade (last summer) and I still love it just as much. It's one of those books that you can just read over and over and over....and you never get tired of it. Charlotte Bronte tells Jane's heartbreaking storing of being mistreated as a child and growing up into a shy, reserved young adult so well. I can see everything in the book happening as I read it. I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"I recently finished reading the book Jane Eyre. It was really good! Even though the vocabulary is somewhat challenging, it was worth it (even if you need a dictionary:)! I enjoyed reading it because it was well-written. Charlotte Bronte has a way of writing descriptions of characters and dialogue with humor. It's also nice to read a book and to be able to say it was worth reading. It doesn't have unpleasant surprises or unnecessary details of violence. It doesn't dwell on violence, either. Though Jane has a rather depressing time in her early life, she doesn't dwell on being unhappy (She kind of reminds me of Cinderella). Read Jane Eyre to find out if her determination to remain virtuous will be stronger than her desire to be with the man she loves and admires!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK AND HEROINE,"JANE EYRE has been my favorite book since my adolesence (I am not so old, though). I have admired the strenght, independence, kindness, gentleness, high class of mind and spirit of Jane Eyre ever since I was 13. Charlotte Bronte's writing stile I love as well--it is a stile of a true writer and artist that she really was. It is enjoyment as well as self-improvement that this book offeres to the reader. Don't miss it! It is so different from nowadays' garbage that we all come across so often!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,beautifully written story,Charlote Bronte is a beautiful writer who brings the reader for an emotional ride. You'll cry for Jane and laugh with her. I am only sixteen and I first read this book when I was fourteen. I fell in love with it and since then have read it many times. It is good when you are feeling sad or happy.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Yes, I bought the book for the cover","I confess it. I bought this copy of Jane Eyre for the cover art.I have always loved the story of Jane Eyre since I was a teen. Everything interested me - the gothic atmosphere, the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester, the mystery of what exactly was locked away in Thornfield...Most of all, I loved Jane as a character. She's not blessed with beauty or wealth, but she is determined to be independant and live her own life. She overcomes hardships, abuse, and grief to live on her own terms. Best of all, she finally does find love. Naturally, that road doesn't run smoothly, but the ending is as it should be.Yes, I have loved Jane Eyre from the very first reading, but never managed to hold on to my own copy. Finally, I decided that I needed to add it to my shelves and started to search for a copy to call my own. One thing that did irriate me were all the various covers of this book. Yes, Jane Eyre is a classic, but I really think all the portraits of women in period garb was overkill. What happened to giving the novel a regular, uncomplicated cover? Honestly, this book is too good to have people turn away because of the ""classic"" look. Let's face it - people do judge books based on the covers. Honestly, all the covers I saw of other editions of this novel just flat out annoyed me.I saw this cover and loved it instantly. Superficial? Sure. However, this edition is worth the extra money in my mind. I often loan books to friends and they never want to read the ""classics"" because the covers look too old fashioned. If it is old, no one really wants to give the book a chance. Jane Eyre stands the test of time. Not everyone can overcome the sight that is on the surface, so this edition works. (And since the popularity of the Twilight series, other classics have been reprinted with pretty coveres with lovely flowers to draw in younger readers - i.e. Pride and Prejudice and Romeo and Juliet - It is only fair that Jane Eyre gets an upgrade too!)The cover is beautiful and captures the eye. I already know and love the story, but I hope this cover will draw in new readers and create new fans of Bronte's work.I realize many may not really agree with my opinion, but I do get pretty bored of all the classics having to have certain covers that commiunicate the fact that they were written in times past. If a novel stands the test of time, why does that cover art have to be stuck in the past? This particular cover isn't overly modern, but not too period in appearance.I saw the cover, thought it was a beautiful fit for Jane Eyre and had to have it. Now I will concentrate on enjoying re-reading this classic over and over again.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A treasure,"I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.""A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.""Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, `Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Must read for all women!!!,"Shortly put Jane Eyre is a story that stays with you long after you have finished reading the book. It is no wonder this tale has been dubbed a classic and remains in popular demand today. It is a wonder to be taken back to a time where people actually stood for their morals and what was right, although this lends to the most frustrating element of the story. The plot between Jane and Mr. Rochester, at its core, is one that subsequent love stories of our time try to emulate (dare I say even the Twilight series borrow from Jane Eyre's sorrow, struggle, and passion). As an avid book reader, this one is placed at the top of my list and in my heart!A true must read for all women!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Wonderful,"This book is currently my favorite novel. I suggest it to anyone and everyone. Jane Eyre was always so interesting and absolutely never boring. Each part of the novel was so enjoyable to read because I got to experience Jane's experiences and adventures with her simultaneously. The whole novel was so youthful and vivacious. I always was yearning for more. And the characters in the novel were so complex, yet identical to the complexity that each individual possesses. This novel is definitely a classic that is entertaining and well-written. Bronte exhibits a sense of expertise with her writing. I adored her writing stylistically. All of her words flowed so fluidly, which I think was conducive to my strong liking for this novel. In the end, I think that anyone would really find this book as an incredible read. I STRONGLY suggest that this novel is read immediately!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"It is Jane Eyre, sir","It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive

I'm not much of a romance reader, so I can't say I enjoyed all of it, but much of this plot is not about romance at all, but a young girl's struggle to find her place in the world and be happy. It definitley kept me reading, and I admire Jane's determination to be strong and do what's right, even when she wants to do the opposite. And it has a happy ending. I love books that end happily. It has a lot of closure. All the main issues in the book are resolved, and beautifully.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre is a fascinating role model,"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is a heroine that possesses independence, intelligence, and inner beauty. This is a fascinating novel that goes beyond the ordinary, trite, misconceptions of &quot;love.&quot; Jane Eyre's experiences prevail upon the reader so strongly, that one feels as if one has learned a great deal upon finishing this novel. It is also much better written than most modern-day novels we see today. If you enjoy other novels from Emily Bronte or Jane Austen, you will no doubt enjoy this one.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"&quot;To prolong doubt was to prolong hope.&quot; - Jane EyreHow true! This book displays an almost unusual scenario. An orphan thrown into a tumultuous life and endures to find a man above her social ranking to love. What is more interesting that neither contain perfect beauty in the eyes of a passing stranger. Jane Eyre is the perfect example of love emitting from internal thoughts and experiences rather than exterior imagery. One would think the story to be a simple one, but it is so much more than the ordinary love story! Yes, Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester, the wealthy employer, do fall in love. However, it is the dramatic turn in the story that touches the reader most. What does happen in the end to these oh-so-real characters? At times, it seems very unpredictable. The story is worth the time of reading the book. It is unlike any other!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A timeless Classic in the English Canon,"Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition,",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Romance &amp; Everyday Life,"When I first read Jane Eyre, I (and I think many others) was taken in by the odd combination of romance and ominous overtones that makes Jane Eyre such a unique book. Of course, the Victorian-era writing and social commentary also made an impression.But upon reflection, underneath all of this is a story of people with difficult lives learning to find and accept each other and hopefully coming to peace and happiness despite long odds. Maybe my second reading just comes from a twenty-first century mind reading things into a nineteenth century book that just aren't there. But to me, the book does have the feel of a modern story of hardship as well as a Victorian story of people trying to overcome their backgrounds to find love.Jane Eyre tells the life story of an orphaned girl sent away to a harsh boarding school by a cruel aunt. Despite the harsh nature of the school, Jane thrived at the school since she is finally out from her aunt's crushing dislike for her. She graduated and took a job as a governess for a girl in the care of a mysterious man who spent much of his time traveling abroad, Mr. Rochester.At first, the two do not like each other. This is compounded by the fact that Jane thinks she is plain looking and not worthy of his company. But the two develop a peculiar friendship, and there are many signs that their feelings are deeper. But Mr. Rochester is busy courting other ladies at the time. Mr. Rochester also seems to have a secret that he will not divulge to Jane but may have serious consequences for her.Jane's job as a governess and the friendship that develops make it seem that the book will quickly become a Jane Austen book (which of course, would not have been a bad thing) in which the man and woman from different classes find love with one another, but from the point of the friendship blooming, Jane Eyre takes a few remarkable twists and turns that I had not expected and that make for real page-turning.But it is as much the quiet desperation of both Jane and Mr. Rochester and their struggle to find each other despite this that makes Jane Eyre a book truly worth reading and treasuring.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Sure it's dated, but it's enjoyable if you let it be","I read this in order to compare it with JENNA STARBORN, and there's no doubt but that this is the true classic with its Gothic overtones and its portrayal of a strong and independent woman in times not supportive of such strength and independence in women.Many will have difficulty with this book, because it's rich in detail and rich in mood. Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this. If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values. As such, it's not really a book for guys. On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Timeless Classic!,"Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the best literary works I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It has the ability to keep you riveted, unable to put it down. Jane bears an uncanny resemblance to modern day women in that she is independent and strong willed. I had never even heard of this book before attending college and I almost feel cheated. This book does an excellent job of pointing out the many peaks and valleys one will have in their life. The author was able to use her own first-hand knowledge of having suffered through loss in her work.Early in the story we see that Jane has a thirst for knowledge as she finds solace in various books. As an adult she uses her own education to help her become a teacher. She also comes to know love not once but twice. First with Edward Rochester, whom she eventually leaves due to his deceitful ways only to return to later, and second with St. John Rivers who is a missionary on his way to India. Jane doesn't stay with St. John because she believes him to be looking towards her more as a possible missionary than as a wife.I eagerly recommend this book to anyone. It is a masterpiece of literary artwork and lengthy as well. I believe that the young women of today could benefit greatly from reading this book for it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and what they believe in. In my opinion, ""Jane Eyre"" is a must read!",positive

I'm here to express my admiration and love for this book. I've read it more times than I can possibly remember. It is most definitely one of my favorites. It contains one of the most well-known love stories and one of the most well known coming-of-age stories of all time. Cannot be missed! If you skipped reading this in school or have simply forgotten what the talented miss Bronte wrote then I highly recommend reading this and (re)introducing yourself to the story that has inspired millions.,positive

It was never on any assigned reading lists and it wasn't until a few years after college, when I had more time for pleasure reading, that I started on the unassigned classics that I had missed by having a science-based major. It is one of my top five favorite books and absolutely my favorite classic, topping even Pride and Prejudice (which I also love). It has rich, well-written characters, terrific heroine and hero, and contains both tragedy and ultimately, happiness. Worth the time to read and even re-read it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Should Have Read It Long Ago,"Jane EyreWhile another review on this novel is certainly not required and I doubt that I will say anything that has not already been said I will still forge ahead.

It so interested me that I decided to read the book and once I started I literally could not put it down. What a fascinating story! Themes of abuse, bitterness, friendship, betrayal, disappointment, integrity, forgiveness, love, etc. The story is full of intricate plot lines and wonderful and memorable characters. By the end of the book you know these people and you are rejoicing, empathizing, laughing and weeping with them.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Gothic Romance Classic,"On October 16th, of 1847, ""Jane Eyre: An Autobiography"", edited by Currier Bell (pseudonym of Charlotte Bront) was published. It created some controversy at the time, as many believed it was written by a man. The novel was very popular when published, but critical reaction to it varied. Today, it is clearly a classic, the development of a young woman, who does not fit into the stereotype of a nineteenth century woman. She is not submissive, and she struggles to avoid being dependent on others. The original publication was in three volumes, but this Penguin Classics edition is based on the third edition of Jane Eyre, and it is the last edition which Charlotte Bront edited and corrected.The story covers Jane's life from her childhood until her marriage. The childhood chapters can be split into two sections, those where Jane, an orphan, was being raised by her Uncle's family, but her uncle has passed away and her aunt does not like her, but was forced to promise to take care of her. The key parts of this section are Jane's being rejected by the closest thing she has to a family, her morality, and her independence, i.e. her refusal to conform. The second part of her childhood is when she is sent to attend a charity school, called Lowood, where the pupils have to make do with substandard food and clothing. Here Jane finds one teacher who treats her, and the other students, well, Miss Maria Temple. One of the key things in this section is the difference between religion and morality, symbolized by Mr. Brocklehurst a clergyman who is mostly responsible for the appalling conditions at Lowood, and Jane and Miss Temple on the side of morality. Also key is Jane's witnessing her friend, Helen Burns, dying from a typhus epidemic, in spite of her goodness and her submission to the standards imposed by Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Scatcherd, a teacher as cruel as Miss Temple is kind.The story then picks up many years later, with Jane in position as a teacher at Lowood, but looking to move on. She advertises for a position as a governess and is hired by Mrs. Fairfax. She is to take care of Ad&egrave;le Varens, a girl who is being taken care of by Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Manor where Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. This section has a lot to do with class, as well as morality. There is the difficulty of Jane falling in love with someone of a different class. There is also the looking down on Jane as being of a lower class, by Mr. Rochester's peers. The morality questions are here to, in the comparison of the higher classes verses that of the lower class. Even Mr. Rochester's behavior is in question, in the events leading up to Jane leaving. Jane also finds out that she does have family left, and when it appears that she is to have everything, she sends a letter to her father's brother. It is this attempt to reconnect with family that causes her to lose nearly everything as it destroys what she thought she was about to have.The next section details Jane's life after leaving Thornfield Manor. Here she loses almost everything, and is on death's door when she is on the doorstep of Moor House. The Rivers, St. John, Diana, and Mary. It is from this state of having nothing from which she recovers almost everything she could want. Here she recovers her health, she is employed again and regains much of her independence. St. John is in love with a woman, but he will not ask her because he is driven to devote his life to religion. He does find out Jane's true identity though, and this results in Jane learning she has family, and wealth that she didn't know she had. She is pressured by St. John to marry him and join him in his missionary life, but she knows that he doesn't love her. She rejects St. John, and instead goes to find her one love, Mr. Rochester. She now has wealth and family, and she learns that tragedies in Mr. Rochester's life have made what was once impossible possible.It is a long and winding road which Jane travels in this novel. Probably best classified as a gothic romance, it deals with numerous issues and the strength of Jane's character serves as a good role model for young women, and for that matter anyone. The Penguin Classics edition is filled with supporting documentation as always. There is a wonderful introduction by Stevie Davies, along with a Chronology, suggestions for further reading, notes on the text, opinions of the press, and wonderful textual notes which enhance the reading experience and understanding of the reader.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Simply put: a classic.,"Never being a great fan of the Victorian period of English literature, I have always steered clear of the sisters Bronte, Jane Austin, and others of their ilk. It is amazing how much we miss when blinded by prejudice. I not only liked Jane Eyre immensely, but was very impressed by the literary abilities of Charlotte Bronte and regretted that I had not read the novel sooner. Although Bronte did not have the formal education and did not share the literary traditions enjoyed by some of her male colleagues, she grew up in a household in which storytelling was prominent and understood that the first task of any writer is the ability to tell a good story. Jane Eyre is a wonderful creation, a story that keeps the reader's interest from the first, and one in which Bronte introduces to the reading public one of the first truly modern heroines.Charlotte Bronte's novel is a complex and structured work and contains within it elements of romance, picaresque wanderings and a preoccupation for the Gothic themes of mystery and the supernatural. But to describe the work simply as a very good Gothic novel would be to ignore the remarkable characterization that Bronte achieves in the creation of the character of Jane Eyre. Bronte's character is quite unique when compared to other female heroines of the era. Jane is not beautiful and does not enjoy any of the privileges of wealth or social position, and it is clear from the beginning that if Jane is to make her way in the world she will have to do it with a combination of hard work and intelligence, and not be afraid to question accepted social conventions. The decision of Bronte to narrate the tale through the eyes of Jane bonds the reader and the main character together creating an intimacy that is first rate. We share all her hardships and experiences from Gateshead to the final reunion with Mr. Rochester, and sympathize with her moral dilemmas and her indignant stand against religious hypocrisy (a feeling strong enough to have her expound more fully in the preface to the second edition of her novel: ""[The world] may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose - to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it - to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but, hate as it will, it is indebted to him"").Although the creation of the character of Jane is Bronte's greatest achievement, she is possessed with the talent to write a story that is exciting, mysterious and ultimately rewarding - in other words, a pure classic. Bronte may not possess in full the literary style of some of her contemporaries, but she writes with assurance and surprises the reader with some extraordinary passages, beautiful examples that combine nostalgia, religious mysticism and poetic rhythm into a wonderful prose. The influence of the book is still alive over a century later. Jean Rhys uses the novel as the point of departure for her Wide Sargasso Sea, and groups as divergent as Marxists, feminists, and Horatio Alger types all use the book as part of their lexicon.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Say Hello to One of British Literature's Greatest Heroines,"Let me just be out with it: I love Jane Eyre. It is my mom's favorite novel of all times and definitely in my (constantly changing) top 5. The Dover Thrift Edition is a wonderfully inexpensive way to get wonderful literature into people's hands, so I am pro-Dover, all the way. But to speak to the novel itself, it's a classic that's been remade into films so many times because it is a great story artfully told. Jane is one of my all-time favorite literary characters, and almost definitely my favorite female one. If you hate romance novels which have the prerequisite of a jaw-droppingly beautiful heroine, let me introduce you to Miss Eyre (though if she were alive today, she might insist on Ms.) Jane is described as ""plain"" throughout the novel, and this not-terribly-flattering adjective applies to her on several levels (her appearance, her plain-speaking manner, her direct way of dealing with problems). Because of the first-person narration and the abundance of details of her early life, the reader is drawn into a close relationship with Jane, and to know her is to love her. Here is someone I readily admire with her pluck and nerve tempered by a healthy dose of humility. Jane seems like such a real person as we get right inside her thoughts and see her deepest longings, doubts, and fears. To me the most telling scene is (hopefully not too much of a spoiler) when Jane unfavorably compares herself to Mr. Rochester's presumed sweetheart, the beautiful Blanche Ingraham. To cure herself of any flights of romantic fantasy she may be tempted to indulge in over her boss, she forces herself to make two very realistic drawings, one of herself and one of Blanche, and study them closely, hoping to cure herself of the foolish notion that a man might prefer her to gorgeous Blanche. Wow, what a woman! How many of us have the strength of will or character to study our weaknesses in as strong a light as possible in order to disabuse ourselves of notions we fear may be dangerous? Jane certainly doesn't suffer from the too-common (modern?) disease of self-importance, and we see how this, combined with her certain moral compass, guide her to do the right thing(s) even when they are not in any way fun or pleasant. Pick up a copy of Jane Eyre if you haven't read it before and give one of British literature's most interesting creations the chance to win you over.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A timeless Gothic masterpiece.,"Some modern readers may find it hard to believe that this little Gothic novel created quite the scandal in its day. The novel is based on an orphan by the name of Jane Eyre, who is raised by her aunt, the cold-hearted and cruel Mrs Reed. Jane's early childhood is one marked by violence and neglect. Early on, however, the readers learn that little Jane Eyre has a fiery spirit that refuses to become a victim of its oppressive enviroment. She boldly lashes out at those who mean to demean her and constantly remind of her station in life.When Jane fondest wish comes true, she leaves behind her wretched existence at Gateshead House and arrives at Lowood school. Jane's life at the orphan boarding school proves just as trying as her time at Gateshead. Behind the walls of Lowood, Jane suffers many privations and witnesses many acts of cruelty. She remains at Loowood for eight years, first as a pupil then as a teacher. Jane's urgent need for change prompts her to seek a position as a governess. She finds such a position at Thornfield Hall, the home of Edward Rochester, who the narrator falls deeply in love with.The character of Jane Eyre is extremely modern. Readers today will have little problem identifying with her thoughts and wishes. Although of low social standing, Jane speaks her mind to those who mean to subdue her. She reminds her aunt of her promise to look after her when she abuses her as a child. She defies the teachers at Lowood. She refuses to become Mr Rochester's mistress. Jane choses her own happiness over what is expected of her, not a very attractive quality in women in Victorian society, but one modern readers can sympathize withCharlotte Bronte used several personal life experiences as inspiration for this novel. Like Jane, Charlotte attended a boarding school, where she experienced many of the tribulations Jane suffered. The death of Helen Burns at Lowood from tuberculosis was inspired by the death of her sisters Elizabeth and Maria, at The Clergy Daughter's School from the same disease. Jane Eyre is one of the best classics. It's dark and tragic, yet emotional and even amusing at times. Definitely one of my favorites.",positive

Jane Eyre is the only book that made me cry, made me never want to finish it, and it was my best friend. After I read it, I felt as If I lived her life, and felt her pain. THis book is so much better than Wuthering Heihghts. Read this a million times, and I promise that not once, you will get tired of it. *Not once* So after you get this message, go out ... and buy this book!

Her reading voice is pleasant and natural-sounding and she conveys just the right amount of emotion. She also manages to vary the tone of her voice just enough that can differentiate between characters but not so much that she sounds foolish.The only drawback to this audio book is that it is recorded on two tracks.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Bronte sister's most compelling novel!,"In, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; it is obvious to tell that the author, Charlotte Bronte is the sister of Emily Bronte. The dark tone and twisted love story are all to analogous traits of Emily's Bronte's story, &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Much like Charlotte, Jane is an unattractive girl, who grows up in a school for girls where the accomidations are all but comfortable. She grows to be very inteligent, however, is not the most sought after girl in England. She becomes a governess for a man named Mr. Rochester. Jane is in love with Mr. Rochester, but his dark secrets and overbearing temper are almost too much for Jane to live with. Of all the Bronte books, Jane Eyre is among the finest. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is interesting and encapturing, but the life of Jane, and her triumphs are far more compelling. Jane Eyre is a classic, that should be read at least once, if not more, by every girl who is searching for a place in this world. The expierences Jane has on her road to becoming a woman are a very interesting reflection of Charlotte Bronte's encounters. Perhaps this is what makes the story so interesting?!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I cheered and cried all at the same time...,"To be honest, I haven't read many classics, but this is by far my favorite book ever. I was assigned to read it for school and am now completely obsessed. I have three different copies of the story, but my first copy was this cover.What makes this book endurable and able to plow through for the first one-hundred-thirty pages and then keep reading for the next three-hundred-forty-one is the characterization. You love Jane, you hate Mr. Brocklehurst, and I don't know about anybody else, but I loved Mr. Rochester, Helen Burns, and Diana and hated St. John Rivers and Mrs. Reed. All characters stir feelings of either love or hate in you. This truly is the first, and the best, soap opera in the world!I was told by some that they thought the ending lacked - ha ha! The ending couldn't have been better in my opinion. I, personally, didn't see it coming. When Jane was actually contemplating marrying St. John Rivers, I openly yelled ""No! No! You can't marry him! You love Mr. Rochester whether he's married to a lunatic or not! Don't marry the moron! He's forcing you into it!""This book evoked emotions from me I've never gotten before while reading a book. It evoked emotions I never even got watching a movie. Well, maybe it did, only they were excrutiatingly amplified. It was painful to read of Jane leaving Thornfield, even more painful to watch this self-respecting woman beg for food, and yet uplifting to read of her scorning St. John's idea of love and Mrs. Fairfax's label of ""beggar.""All in all, whether you're assigned to read it or not, ""Jane Eyre"" is overly well worth its 461 pages.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,It pains me to see my dear books torn by other readers,"Dear Anti-Bronte readersI beg you, don't review the books that you read in English class. I noticed that you tend to get to be prejudiced against the book... What do you mean that it's a child's foolery? What do you mean that the author had nothing better to do? Do you know that Bronte was very ill from the beginning of her life and the literature was the only thing that could keep her going up to her short life? Do you know that her beautiful symbolisms and enormous passion for life, let aside the unique plot and attractive characters, reflect her deep understanding of history and literature? She is a thoroughly educated and intelligent author. Her conversations are deliberately yet unconsciously designed. A choice of a word, a sentense is one by one patient, full of love, and &quot;complete beauty, like a Greek statue of Apollo... (quoted from the book)&quot; I can't praise this book enough, I'm usually very tough on literatures... I even think Kafka's Metamorphosis, with its moving plot and unique characters, is 4.5 out 5 stars... So read more and get some real experience, before you do actual reviewing. Your childish rates and opinions might turn away and repel some readers thus reduce their life to the level of yours.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A love story to last another 200 years...and more,"It was a book my Grandmother told me I should read. I just decided to buy it on impulse really, not knowing what I was getting myself into. I opened the book and was immedeately swept into Jane Eyre's world. My mind played out all of the scenes as I read, only a truly masterful piece of work could create images so strongly right from the start. Charlotte Bronte creates a masterful work of art on the pages of this book.When the book begins, you are taken into Jane's childhood, and given a sense of what it's like to have no love, and no hope of the future. You can actually see the pain on Jane's face. Then at Lowood, you learn with her, and grow with her. Finally, on the night she arrives at Thornfield Hall you are overcome with anticipation for Jane. What is this life going to be like? Then when Edward Rochester appears, you hate him. You can't believe that he talks to her that way. After a while though, things soften, and Miss Bronte introduces a new feeling. Love. The painting seems complete when Jane and Mr. Rochester confess their feelings, and you wonder, what could possibly be better than this? The ending,(which I won't give away)is absolutely breathtaking. I cried for a half an hour when I read it. It was at four in the morning mind you,(the book was so good I could not put it down.)The characters in the novel are whole, they seem like real people. Charlotte Bronte uses her pen to paint a wonderful picture, one can not help but be engulfed in the color. The book has lasted almost 200 years, I see no reason why it could not last forever. If you ever want to read a classic love story that defines the power of women in literature, then Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is it. I'm 16 years old, and if a teenager can be moved to tears while reading, it must be quite a piece of literature. I walked away feeling like I had taken an amazing journey, and found a new friend in Jane Eyre.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Missed Opportunities but Very Enjoyable,"&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic of English literature and, although it's easy to see why, I do feel the author missed some opportunities to make this very good book even better.The character of Jane Eyre is a very believable and sympathetic protagonist. No, she's not perfect, as a child or as an adult, and this is all to the the good. She is warm and caring with a tremendous capacity for love to which, understandably, she's afraid to give free rein.Jane's years as a child, both with her relatives and at school, are interesting, but only to a point. They seemed to drag and I was so glad when she finally graduated and the story &quot;really began.&quot;It was during the middle section of the book, during Jane's time in Mr. Rochester's employ, that I felt Bronte missed several good opportunities to &quot;up&quot; both the suspense and the reader's interest. For example, we learn too quickly who Mrs. Rochester is and why she does the things she does. I think Bronte should have built this section up more slowly.After Jane leaves the Rochester estate, her meeting with her &quot;new&quot; family is extremely far-fetched. I know, readers weren't as demanding in Bronte's day as they are now, but still, I thought this was the weakest section of the book and the least interesting by far.Overall, I think &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that clearly showcases the class distinctions of the times. This is particularly evident in the early chapters, when Jane is still a child and in the chapters that take place during her employment in the Rochester household.&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that's dated, of course. Times change and reading tastes do, too. If one keeps this in mind, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; should prove to be both a memorable and enjoyable reading experience.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Plain-Jane,"Have you ever wanted someone to notice your personality instead of focusing on your outer appearance? If so, then you can relate to the title character in Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. Jane, a plain but spirited governess, falls in love with her arrogant employer, Mr. Edward Rochester.Alas, Jane has a bitter rival, the beautiful and accomplished, Baroness Blanche Ingram. As Jane teaches Adele, Mr. Rochester's illegetimate ward, she gains the notice of St. John, a missionary. This classic takes you through her life- from governess to heiress.If you like a challenging read, you will definately enjoy Jane Eyre. This book is highly recommended to young adult readers. This novel is full of advanced vocabulary and even French conversations! But you don't have to be bilingual to love this remarkable story.This classic has an emontional and romantic voice. Jane is very much in love with Mr. Rochester, as you can see by this quote: &quot;[He] was becoming to me, my whole world; almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.As you can see, Jane Eyre is a complicated novel, but worth the time it takes to read it.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Love the Audio CD-Don't get what women see in Rochester,"I bought this book as an audio CD for a trip I was taking with my son. Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story. Jane should have dumped him and not looked back. He is a cad and not worthy of true love. What am I missing?",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"While not fatal, the flaws are serious enough to prevent Jane Eyre from being a true masterpiece","** spoiler alert ** After my extreme disappointment with Shirley, I returned to Jane Eyre, which I first read as a 'tween and from time to time afterwards would dip back into the romantic bits no St. John!) to finally read it again cover-to-cover. In this novel, Bronte writes like a pro, opening the story with a conflict that immediately engages her readers' interest in Jane and quickly follows up with another that firmly cements that affection. When the evil Rev. Brocklehurst asks Jane what she must do to avoid the eternal torture of hell, she replies, ""I must keep in good health, and not die,"" and her immortality as a literary character is secured. One strength of this novel is the first-person narration with everything seen through Jane's eyes. Although we know her to be a passionate individual, she is also absolutely trustworthy,and the generous and smart woman she becomes plays no games in telling her tale in simple, straightforward narration. We burn with indignation at Aunt Reed and Rev. Brocklehurst, grieve over Helen, share her growing affection for Sophie and Mrs. Fairfax, and rejoice in her discovery that in Rochester she has at last found someone who is her intellectual and emotional equal, the first true friend since leaving Lowood School. In short, in the first two-thirds of Jane Eyre, Bronte's work is close to a masterpiece. However, her story goes off the rails in the St. John Rivers section, the part of the book that many readers dislike and the section most film adaptions do their best to diminish or eliminate. In earlier readings, Jane's decision to flee Thornfield with a few shillings and a small bundle of clothes made perfect sense, and her subsequent discovery that the Rivers siblings were actually family -- her first cousins -- adequate explanation for her decision to share equally with them the fortune left to Jane by their uncle in Madeira. But on this reading I saw how unnecessary, how unJane-like, her flight actually is. Jane has already learned from her Aunt Reed that her uncle intends to leave her his fortune, and it is that uncle who sends his solicitor to crash her wedding and prevent her bogus marriage to Rochester. The solicitor explains exactly that before leaving Thornfield. Above all else, Jane Eyre is smart and capable, smart enough to recognize that her uncle's solicitor will provide her with necessary support and capable enough to get herself to London to receive it. However, a few hours later, Bronte sends Jane rushing across the moors in a coach heading god knows where, a destination that will be determined by how far her meager money can pay for transport. Is this the young woman who ably advertised for a post when she wanted a new life? Is this the young woman who traveled to her aunt's deathbed and remained long enough to help her hateful cousins settle their affairs following their mother's death? Absolutely not. While Jane's flight makes sense, her decision to flee blindly to parts unknown is ludicrous, given everything else we know about her. And so the results of that flight -- her fortuitous discovery of her cousins and the jousting with priggish St. John over his desire to have her join him in his missionary work as his wife -- are ludicrous as well. No wonder readers recoil from that section of the book. Having written Jane out of character and into a tight corner with Rivers, Bronte comes to her rescue with a hokey gimmick -- the sound of Rochester's voice calling her name across the vast moors that divide them. Jane's dear readers are certainly happy that she has found a loving family and secured an income that provides independence. And they're happy that Rochester has proven himself a man of honor in sacrificing his vision and his hand in attempting to save his mad wife from the burning battlements of Thornfield Hall. So they forgive Bronte the flaws of the St. John Rivers section of the novel, glossing over it as quickly as possible to arrive at Jane's well-deserved happy ending. But while not fatal, the flaws are serious enough to prevent Jane Eyre from being a true masterpiece.",positive

But I like it... perhaps too much. Now, if I knew how to use them in a sentence, it would be impressive; a feat of composition, to be sure.So, what can I add to six million reviews?Well, if your library consists only of sparkly vampire books, bondage thrillers, ""George Washington, zombie-dragon-vampire-killer, and part-time Twitter God,"" then I suggest you return to classic literature and dive into an amazing world. Jane Eyre is one of many phenomenal books that will cling to your memory long after you have completed them.Now, in full disclosure, I read this, partly because I was never forced to in college; and partially because I wanted to write a piece of bizarro fiction that was centered around Ms. Eyre (one that does not involve zombies or vampires). But I found myself drawn into the novel and captivated by the storytelling. Even as a man, I found myself empathizing with Eyre, feeling the mud as it clung to my clothes in that desperate moment of dangerous hope and determined self-reliance. The characters were real, vivid, and I can hear Grace Poole even now, chuckling mirthlessly. The writing is that good, 165 years later.If you haven't already, read it!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Not the Best,"Jane EyreThe book starts out with a young girl, Jane Eyre, living at Gateshed with her late uncle's wife, Mrs. Reed. Jane's aunt and her cousins were mean to her growing up. Her aunt sends her to Broklehurst where she attends school till she is 18. When she leaves the school she gets a job at Thornfield Hall where she is a young girl's governess. When things take a turn for the worst, Jane leaves Thornfield Hall. While wandering through the streets homeless one night, Jane finally finds something she had been looking for all her life, family.Jane Eyre was not that exciting in my opinion. It was, however, not the most boring book I have ever read. The book was not that eventful. Jane just kept going form place to place. She just talks about how she felt unloved and unwanted. The only thing I did like about the book was the love story that evolved between Jane and another character.I would recommend this book to people ages 15 and up. This book is for those who have a wide range of vocabulary. The author uses words that people may not understand if they don't have a large vocabulary. I know while I was reading the book, I had questions about some of the words used.R.K.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A god book,"This is one of the best story's ever written in English Literature. It shows the struggle that woman had to live in the mid 1800's. The book show the strength one woman has in her time of mourning, and her power to let her love for one man conquer over all. I have reminised several times over how the story comes into veiw with woman of today, and have found that it can show woman just how far we have come in a centuy and 1/2.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,true romance?,"This book is an old fashioned romance. Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.This particular edition is illustrated by Dame Darcy (who looks pretty interesting if the back cover is any indicator), and it's definitely a good supplement to the book -- dark, a little creepy, yet also vaguely quirky in a childlike way.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,More than a classic,"As a writer with an MA in literature, I of course read this book as a adolescent and as part of courses in Victorian English writing. The book is a little long--but then all Victorian novels are (people had more time to read then),but the material before about who Charlotte Bronte was and that she served as a governess herself gave tremendous background to what might seem like an over-dramatic story. Charlotte Bronte was one of the first novelists to talk about the plight of single women (who had to make a living) of that era in England. Descriptions of the country side and the travel by coach are amazing and the reader feels as if he/she can actually see and experience what it must have been like to live and travel there.Charlotte Bronte's characters are sharply delineated and the main character is a strong woman in an era of weak ones; I compared them with some of the strong women found in the novels of Jane Austen. I definitely recommend it for winter reading, when there is time to snuggle up to a wood stove or fireplace with a cup of cocoa or a glass of wine and immerse oneself in another era. Probably not for male readers unless they are English majors or really appreciate women.",positive

The plot developed way too slowly for my liking though, and I found myself quickly reading through the ""stuffing"" to get to the juicy parts. Throughout the novel the reader gets to know the characters involved very well, and even though they aren't very realistic, they are pleasantly developed, and fun to watch grow; Jane, the main character, proved to be the most satisfying character to follow and watch grow. However, this book is written in Victorian style language, and I found this style to be incredibly boring and difficult to read through or understand at times, but the themes and motifs embedded within this novel are effectively incorporated, and they kept the reader interested in analyzing the text. As for the ending of the book, I must say that I was very satisfied; with most of the intense emotional action happening towards the end of the novel I'm not surprised Bronte found a nice, and pleasant way to end her story. Overall, this book is great for classroom discussions, or to just sit down and read for fun. Enjoy :)",positive

The sentence structure is very long winded and contains a lot of imagery and metaphoric phrases. I hope to the outcome of Jane's life in the future, but I thought that its not very appropriate now in our modern society.The characters i think is well develop in the novel, but the only thing that don't convince me is the unfortunate events that the characters done in the novel is not very realistic. Other than that I thought that this book if a fine piece of classic literature so I praise the author Charlotte Bronta for it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Very good, until the end!","Looking for a classic romance novel? Jane Eyre is the book for you. Jane Eyre follows the life of a ""plain Jane"" and goes through the hardships and successes that she does. The author, Charlotte Bronte, wrote the novel from Jane's perspective so the reader can get and insight into Jane's mind and truly feel the emotions that Jane is feeling. At points of conflict, the reader will often find themselves hoping and wanting Jane to make a certain decision. Jane's life does not start out easy and so the reader immediately gains pity and empathy for Jane. It is the classic story of whether a girl should follow her head or her heart. Bronte writes in beautiful, eloquent language that paints a very clear picture for the reader. There are points in the novel where it is just the constant flow of Jane's thoughts, but that adds to the immense character development. As the reader gets to know Jane, they are able to relate to her because she is painted to be a very plain, yet strong-willed, young woman. The mark of Jane's passion comes from the beginning when she is talking to her aunt and says, ""I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty."" From this point on, the reader can see that even though Jane wants to be a ""good child,"" she has a more rebellious streak in her. Jane Eyre is a good read for someone who likes very good character development and has patience to get through much detail. I personally did not like the ending very much because it seemed to contradict the main idea of the rest of the novel, but other than that, I found myself engaged and interested in Jane's life and her decisions.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.""Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.""Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Compelling Story of a Girl's Search for Independence,"""Jane Eyre"" by Charlotte Bronte is a classic gothic romance story. Its intense, thrilling, and disturbinging details are told from the autobiographical standpoint of the narrator, Jane Eyre. A definite feminist novel, Bronte created an untraditional character who defies the expectations society has of her. Jane is no Disney character; Bronte's heroine is not blessed with beauty nor money, but she is a fiercely independent character with remarkably complex emotions.The novel begins with Jane Eyre, as an orphaned child, living at Gateshead with her Aunt Reed. From the very beginning, readers understand that Jane does not and will not have an easy life. Bullied and suppressed by her aunt and cousins, Jane is an outsider. She is sent to the Red Room as punishment one day by her Aunt Reed. In defiance, even at a young age, Jane exclaims to Mrs. Reed, "" I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I love you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed."" Appalled by her outburst and fueld by her hatred for Jane, Mrs. Reed a decides to sent Jane to Lowood School, an institution for orphaned girls. After years at Lowood, a glimmer of hope appears later when she becomes a governess at Thornfield, home of a certain Mr. Rochester. Since the story is told from the memory of Jane, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the heighted emotional state of Jane and troubles she suffers through.At Thornfield, Jane becomes governess for a little French girl, Adele, and soon becomes entrapped in a spiral of emotions when confronted my Mr. Rochester. It is clear that Jane is the subordinate and Mr. Rochester is the master, but one cannot help but root for their romance and love to endure. Bronte's story of dark gothic elements, insanity, and dark lingering secrets make up this tragic romance story. Bronte draws attention to the cultural assumption of the Victorian woman's role and the relations between a man and women in the 19th century. Her novel calls for women's equality and equal treatment.The characters are very thoroughly developed. From the point of view of Jane, as a reader, we learn every bit of detail about Jane: her plainness, her loyalty, and unwavering independence. When confronted, Jane demands, ""'Do you think I can stay and become nothing to you? do you think I am an automaton? - a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? you think wrong! - I have as much soul as you - and full as much hart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.'"" Such an exclamation defied the stereotypes of a subdued and quiet lady.Interweaved throughout her novel, Bronte obviously develops the major theme of female independence and strength. However, Bronte also employs several motifs, one being the constant appearance of wings and birds. At the very beginning of the novel, Jane reads Bewick's History of British Birds which wrote of ""the solitary rocks and promontories by them [the sea-fowl[ only inhabited,"" symbolizing the independence of birds and the ability to fly away that she wished she had. Then at Thornfield, Jane describes a party of guests as ""a flock of white plumy birds."" Upon seeing the ladies and gentlemen at Thornfield, Jane is even more aware of her dependence of others and the lowly status she has claims to. Still, she admires the freedom the guests have to come and go and indulge in frivolous activities. Even Rochester tells Jane to ""be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation."" Each instance, Jane is struggling to find her freedom, her own independence.Jane Eyre is a tantalizing novel deserves to be read. Be prepared for a complex and nuanced plot. Written in true Victorian style, Bronte writes in long, elegant sentences that sometimes takes a few reads to truly understand. The plot she weaves is enrapturing, leaving reader on the edge of his or her seat, just waiting to read what happens next. However, Bronte takes her time developing her plot and ends up writing a three-hundred page book that could have easily fit into one hundred, but perhaps the Victorian readers of her generation had the time to sit down and read longer novels. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, it's a story you won't regret reading!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre Review,"In this gripping novel, Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a fiery young governess who finds love in an unlikely place. Through the use of descriptive and flowery language, Bronte successfully writes a prize winning book with extremely well-developed characters, a dramatic plot, and thought-provoking themes. Jane, the protagonist, is a young orphan living with her cold-hearted and widowed aunt, Sarah Reed. She is taken to Lowood School, where, among severe circumstances, she manages to find a friend called Helen Burns. Later, Jane decides to be a governess so she travels to Thornfield to work for the tall, brooding, and menacing Mr. Rochester. This book is considered to be one of the first feminist books because of Jane's unconventional personality and sense of independence. Jane, although physically plain, surprises and wins the heart of both the reader, and Mr. Rochester through her witty dialogue and frankness. Mr. Rochester maintains the reader's interest with his passionate and strong personality that often shows a soft side when it comes to love. It is most entertaining to read their playful and clever back and forth, as well as to see their fondness for each other grow. The characters in this novel are delightfully well-developed. Bronte does a thorough job of giving all characters life, including the minor characters like Mrs. Fairfax and Miss Temple. She uses foils to really differentiate between characters and to emphasize specific traits that are important, for example, Mr. Rochester and St. John are foils, contrasting St. John's ""handsome Grecian features"" yet cold personality with Mr. Rochester's unhandsome looks and passionate and emotional personality. The title, even though it may not catch the reader's attention, really reflects how Jane thinks of herself as just plain Jane. So don't be fooled by the simple title and long-winded sentences. Jane Eyre will certainly be a surprising, and delightful read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Jane Eyre: Themes, Characters, etc.","Jane Eyre is the quintessential feminist novel. Jane is faced with and ultimately opposes her traditional role as a woman in the 1800's as she is subordinate to her love interest, Mr. Rochester. Beforehand, Jane endures a tough childhood as an orphan living with her deceased uncle's family at Gateshead. She is sent away to an ""orphan school"", Lowood, and eventually works as a governess at Thornfield. That is where she meets Rochester, and soon learns of a dark secret that threatens their budding romance. Later on, Jane rejects the love that she feels for Rochester, and leaves Thornfield. She faces trouble and is rescued by a second love interest, St. John. A multitude of events ensue, and this novel closes with an unorthodox, but fitting end.Jane is not the typical female character, as she is outspoken and quite independent. She does not allow herself to be pushed around, which is evident through the incident in which she physically fights with her cousin, John at Gateshead. Jane is confronted with themes of gender roles, social class, love, etc.Rochester is Jane's superior, and their romantic relationship almost replicates their professional relationship. Since he is of wealthy status, and Jane is not, they aren't on equal ground and she is portrayed as his subordinate. This is evident when Rochester refers to Jane as ""my little friend"" among other monikers.St. John is a foil to Rochester in every sense. He is a morally upright individual, who is devoutly religious and appeals to Jane as a cold person overall. This is in stark contrast to Rochester, whom Jane views as warm and has ""flaming"" eyes.In my opinion, the plot was excellent, but was a bit drawn-out. Jane's journey is full of riveting twists, but the build-up was a bit long, and the intricate language of the novel left me uninterested at times. However, regarding the major events and Victorian/Gothic elements, the language/rising action was appropriate, just not as appealing from a modern perspective. The ending was unorthodox, although I did somewhat expect it. Nevertheless, Jane's words reassure that in the end, Jane is not a subordinate, but an equal. She states ""we are precisely suited in character--perfect concord is the result"" which lets go of all of their societal/gender role burdens, and assures that they were meant for each other because of their match in personality/character. There are a multitude of themes present in this novel that require an approach from a wholly different perspective. For example, one cannot understand the importance of the character Jane Eyre within literary history, without considering the fact that she was the first strong/independent female protagonist. This novel, overall, is timeless and is a suitable example of feminist ideals.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,great shape,I received the book in a timely matter and book was in great shape and very clean. Would buy again without a doubt. Thanks,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Great gift!,"I got three of these beautiful Penguin Classics as a gift for a niece about to start high school -- Jane Eyre, Emma, and Pride & Prejudice. She was so excited to open them. These books are lovely presentations of beloved classics, and I like to think they'll be keepsakes one day.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,nice edition of this classic,"This is a nice edition of Jane Eyre. One reason I bought it was because the cover resembles Joan Fontaine, my favorite actress to portray Jane. It has some helpful introductory material, if you are teaching this novel in an English class.One thing that's different about this is it divides the book into volumes, which my previous copy didn't do.I think this book will be very useful as I teach the novel this year.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Great book, a classic, good value",I love a good book and this is certainly one of them.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Original, but boring.","Do you like drama, excitement, action, and adventure? If so, do not read this book! Jane Eyre is a little English girl who is forced to live with her relatives that hate her. At the age of eight, she is forced to move to an orphan school where she has no friends and is continually abused. The book slowly drags through her life at school until she graduates. After spending eight years at school she becomes a governess for a little French brat out in the country. While living at the manor and tutoring the girl, Jane falls in love with the master of the manor. Mr. Rochester is an older man who has traveled all over the world searching for happiness. The rest of the book spends time explaining the controversy between their personalities and how they deal with each other's love. I give this book points for originality, but it needs a more gripping storyline. Only read this book if you need more reading material.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A timeless romance,"Young Jane has a tough childhood growing up with her cousins and aunt after her parents passed away. Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,It's the best book I have ever read.,"This is a really good book. It's a little hard to read because Charlotte Bronte describes everything in such great detail, but that adds to the image of the book. I love how when she does describe it you feel as if you're in the book actually looking at it. I haven't read many books where the author describes thing like she does. If you want a book to enjoy for a long time you should read it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,"True love is blind *well, it is for Jane, anyway*","Bronte shows through Jane that sex is Not one of woman'snecessities. Rochester is ugly, but he has a mind. I wish all womenwere of this opinion.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Zzzzzz....,"I suppose it was an ok book... It probably had a good moral and all that stuff, but there was about 150 pages of excess crap that I, personally, didn't care about! It was just a teeny bit to long.....!",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,Boring and verbose,"This novel is not as it appears to be. English teachers may praise it, your girlfriends may gush over Rochester, and others ""critically acclaim"" it but I have studied it as a piece of literature as well as an entertaining classic. It is not as fabulous as they say.The protagonist is a quivering (and excuse the term but I am at a lost for another word at the moment) nitwit who yearns to be loved. Jane is an orphan who feels as if she would die if nobody loved her and yes, it sounds simplistic but this is exactly what she says. She comes under the employment of Rochester and becomes a governess to a little girl. Meanwhile, she dreams of flaming beds and hears strange noises from the floor above. The splitting of the oak tree during Jane's engagement to Rochester is just rubbish as a symbol of separation and tragedy. The real tragedy though, is the secret that Rochester keeps and for which, Jane accepts.I am amused by how several people believe that Jane Eyre is a feminist novel. I found Jane to be very comfortable lodged in traditional ideals although she makes an attempt to strike out with her own will. It was a struggle to finish the novel (had to, or I would fail my English exam) and to pretend to my enthusiastic teacher that I loved it. If you want real feminism without archaic English, read Carol Shield's 'Unless'. If you want melodramatic romance with just a hint of literature, read 'Wuthering Heights'. If you think that Jane is a misguided feminist, you certainly have to read Jean Rhy's 'Wide Sargasso Sea' who portrays Rochester's secret as a terrible colonial crime.I can understand that some people love this kind of stuff but there are types of people who hate 'Jane Eyre' - they're usually into contemporary novels, ask for their heroes or heroine to yearn for something more than love and for somebody to love them, and need metaphors that are more subtle that freakin' splittin' oak trees.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Read it while you are young!,"Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Love Conquers All,"Like all great literature JANE EYRE can be read again and again revealing new truths and raising fresh questions. For instance, besides the romance between Jane and Edward there is also the contrast provided by the relationship between Jane and St. John.Imagine what may happen if Jane accepts the marriage proposal of St. John and goes with him to some foreign land as the wife of a missionary? In answering that question while taking a closer look at the unfeeling St. John, we see an anti-Christian message in the book. Add to this mix the despicable Mr. Brocklehurst, the school manager who is also minister of Brocklebridge Church, and you receive a very negative view of Christianity. JANE EYRE is a love story with an anti-Christian bias - but the theme proclaiming that love can conquer all is still the dominant message of the novel.The above represents only one perspective. The book of course can be read and interpreted from many other vantage points. For me that is its greatest strength and enjoyment.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"An enduring, and endearing, classic","Jane Eyre is one of my favorite Victorian novels. The feistiness and lovableness of Jane has never faded for me, even after several readings. My favorite passages from the text are those when Jane leaves Rochester and ends up at Marsh End; and when she is &quot;called&quot; by Rochester from afar and flees to return to him. Charlotte Bronte's writing of these passages is raw with emotion and unforgettable. If you have not yet taken the time to read this outstanding piece of Victorian fiction, do so now.

Her devoted love to Rochester was touching. When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Great Read,I rated this book with five stars because it was so interesting to read. It was sad at times. It was also a wonderful love story.I liked Jane's spirit and determination. I did not dislike anything about the book.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Jane Eyre,"While I enjoyed this book, I was disappointed. I found it to be verbose, going on and on for long passages where nothing much changed or happened - just repetitious. In addition, it is profoundly and deeply Christian, to the point of preachiness. This last may not be a problem for you if you happen to share the author's views.However, if you can live with its faults, it is otherwise well written. Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester are well drawn characters, interesting and unexpected. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to hold your interest. And the ending is satisfying, a big plus for me.In summary, it is more dated than, say, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (a personal favorite), but it is still worth reading.(This review is of the unabridged audio version of the book.)",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,The Best Book from the Bronte Family,"This is surely the best book from the Bronte family. Out of any of the books that they have published, this one is by far the closest to being interesting. A lot of neat stuff happens if you pay close attention.The reason why I give this book a three is that I don't see it a as a great work of literature. The are many other books out there (my favorite: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo) that deserve a five. I couldn't bring myself to even give this a four.In all I see Jane Eyre as an ok book. However, it does become very dull at times and you won't pick it up and read it again if you make it to the end.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A wonderful story you will never forget.,"When I was 12 my aunt gave me a copy of Jane Eyre. It was a favorite of hers as a young girl. It quickly became a favorite of my own. It encouraged me to seek out other books like any one of Jane Austen's great novels, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. So I am eternally grateful to my aunt who handed me a small paperback that opened my mind to a world I never knew! I hope to give my own niece a copy of Jane Eyre, and hopefully she will love it like I do. So please, read this book it is wonderful.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,hasn't held up well for me,"I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . .",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Like it or dislike it-- just watch the movie!,"I've had a like/dislike relationship with this book since my college days. All right- mostly dislike.Everyone knows the plot by now, since they at least watched the televised versions, so I'll be brief- neglected orphan who grows up with abusive aunt and cousins is sent to charity school, where she experiences more misfortunes, grows up to become a governess in a gothic countryside mansion and falls in love with her Byronic employer. Eventually she finds fortune and happiness through various plot twists, some completely implausible.I've read this book several times since I was 19 and seemed to dislike it more with each reading. I think that what has always put me off this book is Charlotte Bronte's prose. It's just so cumbersome and long-winded and I find the imagery and descriptions heavy-handed and awkward- sorry, when she describes the ""bonny beck"" I just don't feel it. I much prefer her sister Anne Bronte's simpler but clearer writing, not to mention Emily Bronte's masterful prose. Additionally, Charlotte is completely humorless. What passes as humor just isn't very funny. By contrast, again, Wuthering Heights has surprisingly funny moments for such a dark gothic tale, once again demonstrating Emily's superiority as a writer.I additionally dislike Jane--somehow, I can't feel much liking for her. I appreciate that Bronte broke the mold with having a poor, plain heroine, but it's stressed so frequently that it loses its effect. She was also stupendously blind not to suspect that maybe, just maybe, there's another person there with the stony-faced Grace Poole who was the source of that mad laughter. And Rochester is a manipulative git. He really is. And he says ""Jane, Jane!"" too much and has an irritating tendency to compare her to elves and fairies.What's most surprising is that St. John River is actually a much more interesting character than Rochester. He's a strikingly handsome, repressed ascetic who directs his passion to his religion. Nowadays he would have made either a splendid villain or a disillusioned hero. Rochester and his angst are boring by comparison.If you think that Bronte is a good writer I dare you, just dare you, to read any of her other works. ""Shirley"" is painful and I heard that ""The Professor"" isn't much better. The only work where I felt that Charlotte finally got a handle on her art was her last novel, the emotionally difficult and thereby much less popular ""Villette.""The best thing about Jane Eyre are the television and movie productions. There's a million of them and I find myself compelled to watch every single one. So I guess there is still something in the story that appeals to me. This is why I give this book three stars rather than two.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Spotty,"Jane Eyre is a young woman, grown from a rash girl in a harsh life and boarding school, working as a governess to a French girl. This is Bront's romance novel, though it is somewhat vague to call it that, for there is much more involved than just a petty romance. Through some sticky language, and some boring sections-whole chapters, even-Bront relays the life of Jane Eyre through Jane's own eyes tastefully and with flexible, rich language, stringing the reader along.We begin with Jane Eyre's childhood. Through some difficult wording, we find that Jane lives with her Reed cousins and aunt. Her Aunt Reed sees her as a vile child compared to her own vile children, who she sees with a golden halo above their heads. Jane is often tortured physically by Reed's children, while taking the brunt of anger and blame from her aunt. We are brought through the agonizing years of her childhood, making her a rash young girl with dreams of a new life, which comes in the form of a boarding school that she is to be sent to. With such a rush of feeling, she spills out her heart to her aunt about how she really feels, but at such the young and tender age of 10, begins to discover truths about the world that normal 10 year old children do, such as what vengeance and anger could bring about. As Bront describes the feelings and compares them to some rather unrelated things, ""Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic as wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after flavor, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned,"" I gained a sense of familiarity, for of course, when I pursue revenge, it's often a cold and empty attempt, leaving me cold and empty as she describes.The boarding school is anything but lovely, but Jane often refers to it as better than her previous surroundings; of course, as I, the audience, felt, it was. She begins to accept the discipline and conform rather well to the strict rulings of Mr. Brocklehurst, and, lonely at first, finds someone that she can relate to - Helen Burns, who also often gets lost in her own fantasy world as Jane does. The next chapters are really just an explanation of time in the boarding school, and though rather boring, explained her transition from a brash young girl into something more disciplined. The only truly interesting thing I found in this piece of the book was how Bront utilizes the technique of the `drop' sentence. To explain it, she builds and builds up to a heavy-impact event, and then uses one sentence to release the suspense, in a rather harsh way, making the impact of the shock all the stronger. In the end of her explanation of Jane's childhood, she uses this here: """"...my face against Helen Burns' shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep and Helen was - dead."" Of course, one thinks that there would be much more of a draw out here to Helen, her best friend, dying, but really, it was just a dropped ball, and I found myself shocked. Even so, there was a good five chapters of useless plot that I found to be quite tiresome.As Jane herself transitions to the next chapters, she explains the things that happened the eight years after that that she stayed in the hall, and how things improved, she improved, etc. This seemed to be one of the least confusing parts of the book, since it was straightforward and not so tangled up in language. Either way, she decides that she needs a change from the boarding school that she now taught at, and advertises herself, quickly replied to for a young girl. She immediately accepts and takes her journey to Thornfield. She is to teach a little girl named Ad&egrave;le in a large manor in which the master never seems to be around. There is an in depth, albeit easy to skip over, description of the lavish home that she now resides in, and Jane quickly falls into the routine. Before Mr. Rochester, the owner or Thornfield and a main character, shows up, I enjoy the passage (and the many after them) when Jane falls into her own fantasy world and fails to realize that something is happening, like this, ""...Bessie's Gytrash,-a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head... with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would... The man...broke the spell all at once."" They often occur, but they're so shrouded in incomprehensible old language, usually, that I can't catch them until I realize that I haven't understood a thing I've read, and read it over again. Once Mr. Rochester shows up, the actually romance novel-esque story begins, the true heart of Bront's novel. The two begin to seduce and fall in love with one another, though not right away like in a woman's fantasy, but over time as if it did in reality. There are many events after this, but I've said enough already!Jane Eyre is an entertaining, albeit sometimes confusing and boring, read. This is more of a novel for a person with an in-depth knowledge of the English language (and perhaps a little French) and that's looking for a satisfying read. Bront places foreshadowing and certain events with elegance and not without reasoning, for those small events begin to fall into place for what comes in the end, but are something the reader may skip over, for they're shrouded behind a tangled language and wordy sentences.",neutral
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am Jane Eyre,"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,My favorite novel of all time,"Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word. I read it when I was in seventh grade and have read again at least once a year and I'm now in 12th grade. Each time I read it, I understand it better and the love and depth of emotions of Jane and Mr. Rochester becomes so overwhelming. When I saw that 3rd and seventh graders were reading it and finding it ""odd"" at times, and boring perhaps, it's because of the age thing. You've got to wait a few years and read it again. Trust me, after all those idiotic teen movies, you'll develop a priceless love for Jane Eyre. The only book I've ever found that was so harshly honest and real was Gone With the Wind. And that book I really don't recommend to young readers. I've once saw a reviewer say Jane Eyre wasn't original at all and the parts that were original were bad. I can't possibly fathom how J.E. isn't original. This book is one of the few books in the world where a normal, poor, average girl finds love that usually happens to supermodel types (Dickens was a big fan of the supermodel love). Jane's life has been anything been peachy, but she has the courage and determination to make the most of everything and let bygones be bygones, and she does. If anyone deserves love like Jane and Edward's, it's the both of them. And even in books and movies of the 21st century you'll rarely see a girl as independent as Jane. For an experience never to be forgotten, read Jane Eyre.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Page Turner,"I found this book shoved under my bed last week...it's been there since I was in high school (apparently it never got returned to the school...)I remember starting to read it 6 years ago and only got about five pages in before I lost interest and tossed it aside. However, I started it again a few days ago and completely fell in love. I love the prose, the plot, everything. I just can't keep myself away from it. Bronte's writing style is so poetic and beautiful that the story itself could be absolute trash and I would still love this book.Thankfully, though, the novel is not a load of tosh and the story itself is engaging beyond belief. Jane is left with her uncle's wife when he forces her to care for her when he dies. She's cared for about like Harry is at the Dursleys and escapes to school. Unfortunately for Jane, Hogwarts does not await her, but a rather dreary school. She remains here for 8 years, first as a pupil, then a teacher. She later gains employment for a gentleman who pays her twice her wages at Lowood and there she meets the love of her life. Unfortunate events prevent them from marrying and she continues to seek a happy place and make her way. I won't give away more.If you like Austen you will love this book. It's got the characterization and insight of Austen's books with the adventure of a more modern novel. The average young male probably won't appreciate this particular book, but I advise women at least 16 and older to read it. It is absolutely fascinating and much better than the current pop-literature pumped out today.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Reading with Tequila,"Jane Eyre was long, wordy and old. It was a recipe for instant dislike. While I didn't love the book, I certainly enjoyed it. The character of Jane Eyre was upstanding and brave. She showcased many qualities women strive for and find hard to reach even today. Mr. Rochester was both off-putting and strangely likable at times. The mixture of drama, romance and a bit of mystery was engaging. While I often put the book down, I never once thought of not finishing it. A deserved classic.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Best Book in English Literature...,"Jane Eyre is, in my opinion, the best book ever written. It is a classic that combines mystery and romance effortlessly, in a writing style that is beautifully unique.Jane Eyre is not a heroine, at least in her own opinion. She's orphaned, but educated; penniless, but not without family: just none that would claim her. She accepts a job as a governess to a young French girl named Adele, a Mr. Rochester's ward, who may or may not be his illegitimate daughter.Thus begins the epic romance between the young, plain governess and her grizzled, older employer. But the question remains: can the overcome the greatest obstacle of all - Mr. Rochester's best-kept secret?",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Fantastic peace of literature!,"I loved this book. I can say that the begining was a little boring but as you keep reading you feel captivated by all the obstacles that Jane has to overcome in life. It is a beautiful reading that promotes real love and not just superficial love, the characters are not beautiful or perfect and even thought they are described as ugly, you can not help but to fall in love with them and cry or laugh with them. In general a great reading!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Wonderful book and edition,"Somehow I managed to get through high school and a minor's worth of Brit Lit credits in college (including a Victorian literature class) without ever having to have read this book or seeing any of the movies, numerous as they are. Oddly enough, a facebook quiz is what prompted an interest in this book that I knew close to nothing about beforehand.This book really captured my attention and it has been years since I have loved a book such as this. I usually don't take an interest in novels where love is a major theme of the book, but this is a fine exception. The author captivates the reader so thoroughly through the titled character it is like being told a story with a literary painting. The style of Charlotte Bronte's writing is beautiful, and despite predictability at times, it does not withhold any suspense.As for the edition of this book, the illustrations in both black and white and in colour from artist Darcy Dame made this a great edition. I really can't say how much I loved the illustrations. There is something dark, haunting, and paranormal to these illustrations which is so fitting of the Victorian era, well-known for their high interest in the occult. When I saw this edition in a store, I knew immediately that this was the perfect edition for me, as I love interesting pictures in books. I also have a certain love for ink drawings, so the images within the pages are very welcome as well. This certainly beats many of the dreary looking versions of this book. Yes, I know, don't judge a book by it's cover, in it's most literal sense, but an interesting exterior never hurts a good novel.As for other aesthetics of this edition: the paper is good and the colour illustrations are printed on glossy paper. This is of course in paperback, but it is very nice for paperback and I'm surprised that it did not cost more. A typical edition of Jane Eyre seems to be in the 300-page mark, but this one nears 550 pages due to the slightly larger font which is very welcome when reading heavier works.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Still a Favorite After All These Years,"You read it when you are young and you get one thing from it. Then you go back to it years and years later and find that not only does it maintain its quality, but it reveals an even further message you might have missed the first time- almost like a whole different story that just helps to illuminate the story you gleaned from it the first time you read it. While I don't find it ""gothic"" in the traditional sense, I do see those elements, but most predominate is a story that can be believeable and one which people can relate to on some level with one character or another in today's world. That is why its still a favorite for me after all these years. I consider it a romance novel told through the eyes of a character who does not want to speak about romance; just experiences it. Subtle and refined, but outgoing and with strong convictions at the same time. Same as the character of Jane. And same as Charlotte Bronte.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,3.0,Heartrending Treatment of a Young Woman,"As a caveat I must say that I am not a huge fan of the ""Regency"" novel. And this novel is so typical of that style of 19th Century British Literature. There is a different view of virtue in the Regency novel. In some novels, virtue is defined as heroism in battle, in others virtue is fidelity to one's morals and integrity. In Jane Eyre, virtue is defined as fidelity to one's class or station in society. And this woman, an orphan and governess by profession, is at the bottom of rural English aristocratic society.The character Jane Eyre is best described, at the risk of being crude, as a doormat. Her only concern is to do whatever is necessary to please those around her. In this heart breaking story, Jane goes from being a student in a school for orphaned little girls to being governess to a Mr. Rochester, who is a rude and self-centered man. Rochester takes a liking to Jane because of her never-wavering devotion to his comfort and ego, so he asks her to marry him. And on her wedding day, she finds out that Rochester already has a living wife, a woman who is chained up in his attic because of her madness. Despite the fact that Rochester already has a wife, he asks Jane to live with him as though Jane were his wife. To her credit, Jane does not agree to this. She has enough self-esteem to run away at this insistence, although she takes nothing with her and is impoverished in her flight.So Jane ends up as a pauper on the doorstep of a random rural English family, only to fortuitously discover later that this family are actually her long lost first cousins. They accept her as family after requiring her to spend a cold winter night asleep outside on their doorstep. Ultimately the young man, who is a parson at the local church, asks Jane to marry him. Jane refuses, not because he is her first cousin (interesting how family relationships were viewed so much differently in 19th century rural England than they are today), but because he thinks of Jane more as a colleague than as a romantic partner. Despite her refusal to marry him, she agrees to travel with him to India as a fellow missionary, but he refuses because he wants her as a wife. She is willing to give up her life in the service of a man who wants only to use her, but then this is the same attitude she had toward Rochester. It is definitely a trend in Jane Eyre's life.In the meantime, Jane learns (also fortuitously) that she is the sole heir of a foreign fortune left to her by a long lost uncle. The fortune would elevate her to a member of the gentry, but Jane, being true to her station and her self-identity as a doormat, splits the fortune with her undeserving cousins. However, at least now she is not destitute. She returns to Rochester to discover that Rochester's crazy wife has escaped her chains, burned down the house, killing herself and blinding him. His future is bleak, but this only makes him more attractive to Jane Eyre. She marries him and rebuilds his house and estate. And, at long last, Rochester sees her as more than a tool. It is a nice ending, I suppose, at least as good as it gets for the Regency novel.It is difficult for a 21st century American to relate to the kind of self-degradation that Jane Eyre not only endures but actively works toward in the face of the prospect of a better life. Perhaps it is a tale of true love, unconditional in the face of adversity. It is also a sad commentary on the social values of a bygone era. If nothing else, Jane Eyre offers an answer to those silly nostalgic people who see 19th Century rural England as some sort of golden era. We can be thankful that, in our era, these kinds of values of self-debasement are no longer acceptable.",neutral

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"It is Jane Eyre, sir","It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter.

Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""Jane Eyre"" deserves its standing as a classic in English literature","""Jane Eyre"" is one of the world's best-loved classic novels for so many reasons.It's an exciting piece of feminist literature written at a time when feminist literature was little known and even more poorly accepted. That it is a semi-autobiographical novel written by a staunchly, independent female author who herself was struggling to survive by her own wits and means and stand on her own two feet makes the story all the more poignant and compelling. While it is a prime example of Gothic romance peppered with the typical fixtures of a Gothic novel - the spectral Thornfield manor that seems to attain a life of its own; the allusions to mythological characters such as ghosts and vampires; the uncanny timing of such weather phenomenon as lightning or a chilling, drenching downpour to accompany major events in the novel - it also breaks new ground in that it avoids some of the typical conventions of Victorian literature. And, finally, it is a piece of masterful story-telling built around larger than life characters that for over 150 years has enchanted readers of all ages and thrilled watchers of numerous television and movie adaptations.For those few of you that have yet to read this wonderful novel, the story can be summarized quickly enough. A dying father extracts a death bed promise from his sister to raise his infant daughter, Jane Eyre. The sister, a spiteful and mean spirited woman grows to hate the obligation that Jane represents and soon sends her away to a boarding school. (Did anyone else have flashbacks to Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby when they were reading this portion of the novel?) In spite of the harsh mental and physical cruelty she endures at the hands of the school's administrator and its teachers, Jane survives to become a teacher at the school. Ultimately she leaves to seek her own way in the world and secures a position as governess in the household of Edward Fairfax Rochester.At this point, most readers will correctly guess that Jane and Mr Rochester fall in love with each other but to tell more of the story would be to spoil the effect of this magnificent novel for first time readers.Suffice it to say that Charlotte Bront has woven an enthralling story into the exploration of a multiplicity of themes that will occupy students of the English language novel for decades to come - the interplay of self-respect, morality, conventional mores and religion; the effects of social standing and class discrimination; gender relations in a patriarchal staunchly male-dominated society; legal issues of the day that related to marriage, inheritance and ownership; contrasting extremes of religious zealotry as displayed by Brocklehurst's hypocritical Puritanism reflected against St John Rivers' obsessive but well-intentioned determination to spread Calvinist dogma as a missionary abroad.While many of these issues have clearly been relegated to the history of the 19th century, it's also a fact that much of the controversy that Bront has so eloquently built into her characters' lives persist as issues into our own 21st century. Little wonder that ""Jane Eyre"" has such enduring power in the world of English literature!Highly recommended.Paul Weiss",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,This Particular Version,I will leave the telling of Jane Eyre to some of the other reviewers. This particular version is my favorite. This is the cloth bound version or the book with the lovely attached ribbon bookmark. This is a very lovely version of this book.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A triumphant classic,"Jane Eyre is the story of a young girl who grows up and is forever contrary to her society. The book foreshadows the penalties that society gives for such opposition, but Jane still remains opposed to the role society wants her to have. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and conflict to show her society how a woman can overcome the conventions of her society to live a happy and full life.An example of foreshadowing comes during Jane's engagement. First there is the splitting of the chestnut tree (page 226), soon after Rochester and Jane become engaged: ""Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away."" This event foreshadows how the upcoming wedding between Jane and Rochester will divide the two, sending one away, because they are not ready for marriage. It is not until Jane and Rochester both overcome the conventions of their society that they can have a happy marriage.The most dramatic example of foreshadowing comes right after Jane's dreams. After waking from her disturbing dreams, Jane sees a light in her room and finds a grotesque female figure standing over her (250). The figure is Bertha Mason, who came to terrify Jane out of marriage. After rending Jane's veil in two, Bertha leaves and Jane collapses. The rending of the veil foreshadows the obstacle still in front of Jane's upcoming marriage, and it is not until this obstacle is dealt with that Jane can marry.Aside from foreshadowing, Charlotte Bronte uses symbolism, mostly of birds, to show how Jane's society confines her. For example, Jane's surname comes from the word for a bird's nest, aerie. Rochester gives an additional example of the bird symbolism on page 232 when he says ""Jane, be still, don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation."" Rochester says this when he is trying to convince Jane that they can be married. At this time Jane is struggling with the barriers that her society places on their union. Jane is the bird that society traps in a cage, keeping her away from the man she wants to marry. Eventually, Jane does find a way to overcome her cage and obtain happiness with Rochester.Bronte also uses people to symbolize certain aspects of her society. Mr. Brocklehurst, for example, is the epitome of hypocrisy, as shown during his inspection of Lowood. While surveying the girls in the school, Mr. Brocklehurst condemns one for having naturally curly hair, a vanity of the world in his opinion, and yet Brocklehurst goes so far as to buy curled wigs for his wife and daughters. In addition to this, Brocklehurst manages the funds of Lowood and never allocates enough money to keep the girls sufficiently warm or well fed. Instead of teaching the girls to live pious and frugal lives, he leaves them weakened in front of the onslaught of winter illnesses. These characteristics of Mr. Brocklehurst make him a symbol of the typical man from Jane's society. Jane's ability to overcome the wrongs he does to her shows her society how to rise above society and obtain a happy life.Throughout this book, Jane clashes with the conventions of her society until she rises above them. The greatest example of Jane's opposition to her society is in her successful marriage to Rochester. ""Reader, I married him,"" Jane says on page 397. Jane does not say that they were married, or that Rochester proposed to her again. Instead, she states that she took the active role and married Rochester. Such assertion from a woman went against the standard role of women in Bronte's time. Jane opposes the role that society has established for her and rises above it, obtaining the thing that truly made her happy.Charlotte Bronte focuses on overcoming the conventions of her society by having Jane Eyre oppose and surmount them. Foreshadowing shows how society will react to such opposition, such as when Jane and Rochester are initially engaged. Symbolism also helps to illustrate the confines of convention; they cage Jane just like a bird. And the various clashes between Jane and other characters, even her society, further illustrated the limitations of conventionality. But opposing and overcoming the conventionality of society can lead to true and lasting happiness.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Great Content. A Bit Too Lengthy.,"Charlotte Bronte discusses one the most important issues we face today in our society--namely a girl's struggle to be loved but also to be socially and mentally independent. Jane Eyre is a lonely, miserable child, who finally becomes a happy, satisfied wife. She does so only after struggling and suffering as a child and later as a young woman. Although the content is very interesting for most, I believe that Bronte could have fitted it in 280 instead of 480 pages.Jane initially maintains her romantic relationships superficial since, according to her, they will result in her lack of independence. Jane's romances with Rochester and St. John are not essentially based on true love, and thus, do not flourish. Rochester is interested in Jane because of her intelligence and piano skills; however, Jane believes that the great social differences between her and Rochester make her unworthy of this relation. A marriage would mean abiding by a husband's orders and the household's chores, which definitely is not her connotation of love. Jane's undeveloped romantic relationships fortify her desire for independence and romance simultaneously.Only by becoming socially and economically equal to Rochester does Jane finally seek a deep, lasting romantic relationship, fulfilling Bronte's assertion that a rational balance between emotions and desires is required to become happy. Jane's acquaintance with her cousins provides her the emotional support she seeks throughout the novel. An added support is Jane's inheritance of her wealthy uncle, which makes her not only socially but also economically equal to Rochester. Now that Jane is economically, socially, and emotionally autonomous, she can accept Rochester's proposal.In Jane Eyre, Jane discovers the secret of having a happy life through rationally balancing her desires for independence and her emotions towards Rochester and St. John. Nowadays, many young women struggle to achieve this balance. Therefore, I greatly encourage any who face that same problem to read this book. Maybe you will find your solution in one of the pages.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Good Book,"This is a pretty good book, as far as it captures Jane's character and tells a decent story of romance. Although i have to say that the plot isn't really the tightest, the righting and foreshadowing is very fine, and the play between the narrator describing herself and others.Like Jane herself says, she is not really an angel, and really is more of a woman's woman than otherwise, just by the way the plot turns out. On the one hand she defends her virtue, and her ""station"", in a reasonable sort of way, but the narrator of course is the character, and she gets a bit self-righteous and indignant at times without much good cause. The ""idea"" of love kind of turns out to be just what will make the best story. Of course a good story is hard to write, but this is why I say it has the feel of an indignant biography.Other than that I wouldn't knock this book too much. The opening 10 chapters and Helen Burns are very touching and you'll see the character, try to survive and lose all of the sweetness that a Helen Burns has over time, which is kind of sad in a way. The book is good though b/c it shows the reasons for her emotional decline from Helen's sort of pure beautiful spirituality into a real sort of adult. I'm not a historian of this period or anything, but it seems like this book is pretty good.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,descripteful yet romantic and passionate,"I think Jane Eyre is a book full of love and point.

But, beware as Jane is falling madly in love with Mr. Rochester (her master as she calls him-is it just me or is I Dream of Jeanie popoing into my head), who has a secret terrible enough to destroy Jane and himself too. I recommemd this book for the older more mature reader (13 and up). Even though nine year olds can read this book, to fully understand the passion and adult situations you must be a little more mature. To really fully understand Jane Eyre you must read past the words and into the heart of little troubled Jane.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,An overall great book.,"Jane Eyre was a book that I thought was very wel written and I think that if you are an ambitious enough reader, that you can ignore the age suggestins on any type of book.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Mysterious book that is a true classic in it's own mind,"I've never read a piece of work by the Brontes' till I stumbled on this book. I looked at the beautiful cover and said, this looks interesting. I know you are not suppose to judge a book by its cover, so before I got it, I read the first chapter. I was instantly in a world of my own which only inhabited a young girl named, Jane Eyre. I got it out as fast as I could and started to get far away from the world, in this book. I read it constantly, not wanting to put it down. I was surrounded by mystery and passion and thrills all at the same time. The characters were so life-like that I felt like I was standing right next to them, observing them from every angle. It was the most, thrilling experience I've ever had from a book besides 'Little Women.' The writing, it's so creative and follows the rules of realism and describation and the beautiful flow of language. I just couldn't believe that the whole story was fiction and was made up in the author's mind. It seems that it actually happened. This book is a classic and if you haven't read it yet, you are just missing out. I would like anyone who wants to be inspired to write read Ms. Charlotte Bronte's words. Since I'm a writer, it has helped me so much. But, if you are not a writer, I would still recommend it to readers who like to be immersed in books. Everyone should read this!!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Great book!,"While I do admit that I did not read this book of my own free will (It was on my summer reading list), I really liked this book. When I started reading it I found it more than a little boring and wanted to throw in the towel. But, as I got to the heart of the novel I found myself in a thrilling love story with a strange twist. It really wasn't that hard to understand once I got used to the language. This book may be more appealing to females than males due to the female heroine. I honestly couldn't put it down and breezed through it in less than a week. I even read it twice! It is a great mixture of romance and horor and I recomend it.",positive

When I read this book, I AM Jane; I feel her anguish, her pain, her excruciating love for Rochester. I feel her desolation when she dreams of him and wakes up alone. Every girl should read this book. As a matter of fact, guys should read this too. Definitely a 10!!!!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Changing Understanding,"Although classics are largely respected books for their ability to withstand the test of time, in most cases, these classics often seem overly erudite for most students. JANE EYRE seemed to, at first, embody the rather intimidating characteristics of a classic, but I later learned that it was my lack of experience, not my lack of old-English proficiency that hindered my true respect and understanding for the novel.Compared to other classics, such as the novels of Charles Dickinson, JANE EYRE presents itself in a more approachable style of writing. This helps readers of many different English proficiency levels be able to understand Jane Eyre's tragic events and unusual acquaintances.Despite the fact that many can grasp the literal meaning of the story, it takes a lot more experience and wisdom to be able to fully understand the underlying messages. Some themes that were hidden were the limitations of women in society and the conflict that people have to accept themselves.JANE EYRE, quite truthfully, was a rather slow and sometimes dull read for me. Although my first read was disappointing, I'm sure that I will be able to learn more from the novel when reading it in the future when I encountered different events and experiences. This unending learning that can be earned from reading classics is probably what justifies their endurance through continuous changes in culture and language. I highly encourage readers to read JANE EYRE periodically throughout their life because a new side of this book will be revealed every time it is read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Great book,"For me, the book was a little slow getting started. But it was definitely worth the read. I'm glad I finally read this book after all these years.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A True Classic for the Ages,"Jane Eyre truly deserves its place in the pantheon of classic literature. The story of the orphan Jane Eyre pulls the reader in and doesn't let go. The reader is taken on a fascinating ride exploring passion, morality, and humanity. The first person narrative is extremely engaging as the title character is do deep and unique. Highly recommend this book to all readers.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Simply The best, the best!","I read this book every few years and every time and as I get older, it is such a joyful and rewarding experience, and each time very different, it is my all time favorite. Jane Eyre is the rare heroine with fiercely independent and astute mind, an excellent model, particularly for girls and women in our time where the illusion of progress often clouds the reality of self and other imposed exploitation. A Must, essential read!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Exciting coming-of-age tale,"""Jane Eyre"" is an exciting coming-of-age tale that spans her life from age 10 to about age 30. This is a classic that I think young women will enjoy because it presents a strong heroine in Jane, who faces hardship and temptation as she grows up and later deals with romance and creating a secure, stable position in life for herself.As a man, reading the book for the first time, I enjoyed watching the story unfold through Jane's eyes. Sometimes she makes what I thought were foolish choices, but she remains true to her character. She also maintains trust in God, and I was surprised how many references there were in the book to both Bible concepts and characters.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Classic!,"Nope, I've never read this book until now. Can you believe it?! One of my goals for 2011 was to finally read the classic Jane Eyre and I am so glad I did! I get nervous reading classics. Alas my concerns were for naught because I thoroughly loved this book and I would highly recommend that everyone read this classic novel if they never have before (or re-read it if they haven't read it since high-school)!Having enticed my book club to join me in reading it since the movie adaptation was coming out in March as well, we had Jane Eyre as our March book pick, so with that I settled in for a classic read. Every time I sat down to read this book it would take a few pages to get back into the language but once I did, it didn't bother me and I totally understood everything that was going on, I just let it wash over me.Jane, how I loved you. You were strong at a time when many women were not. Your life sucked! If you are ever feeling down about yourself, pick this book up because it will make you feel better about your own lot. Poor little Jane did not have an easy start in life but she dealt with her hand and got through it, becoming quite the young little lady.Then she met Edward Rochester. Oh my goodness, brooding, ugly (as defined by Jane), kinda mean to his ward Adele, hiding crazy wives in the attic, Rochester. And guess what, even with all of this against him? We still kind of love him! Jane wants Rochester and Rochester wants Jane, but there are twists in the plot to keep them apart so will they be together? Oh so much angst and pining in this book will be had!Like I said, I am so glad I read it and would heartily recommend it to others. Everyone in my book club really enjoyed it as well, some more than others, and all seemed glad they read it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am Jane Eyre,"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...""Jane Eyre"" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (""She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart""). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being ""passionate,"" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, ""Jane Eyre"" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Surprisingly Exciting,"I thought I would never read Jane Eyre. I'd seen the old Joan Fontaine-Orson Welles film - very nice - and that seemed to be enough for me. But Amazon's generous list of free or nearly free classics for Kindle got me to thinking I might try some of the Victorian novels I had long resisted. And I'm so glad I did.Jane Eyre turned out to be a surprisingly exciting, even thrilling read! It was very hard for me to put it down, and I was up many nights until 2AM because I wanted to know what would happen next. I can't believe a 160-year old novel could cast such a spell on me, but it did.This is a very satisfying, very exciting and emotional book. It is not so simple as any of the movie versions would lead you to believe. Jane is a wonderfully complex and compelling character, especially as she endures the struggles between her heart and her reason, between her desires and what she feels is right.Most highly recommended.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Best of the Best,"The first time I was introduced to this book was in college. Back then, I had the attention span of a gnat, so rather than give Jane Eyre a try, I opted for Cliffs Notes. (Yeah, I know ... sacrilege)Anyway, fast forward to now. I finally read it, and my God, what a beautiful piece of literature! The first part outlining young Jane's struggles had me flipping the pages till one in the morning. Then when she got to Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester, the page turning didn't stop till at least 3 A.M. I savored every paragraph, every word. It was like crack to me. lolI was so enthralled with this story that I wrote a post on it when I hadn't even finished reading the book! I'd reached a section that moved me so much I had to write about it because of its beauty. It showed the core of just who Jane was as a heroine. Here's a snippet:WARNING .... SPOILERS.........Last night, I read something that really moved me, so much that I must've re-read it three times. It was an introspective passage that poignantly demonstrated the beauty and complexity of Jane's mind. Oh, how I wish my heroines were this self-aware and confident!In discussing her opinion of Blanche Ingram (the gold-digging skank who Mr. Rochester is using to make Jane jealous), our heroine goes into great detail about why she cannot bring herself to be jealous of Miss Ingram. Jane isn't a character in denial. She's a strong, logical, thoughtful and methodical woman, one who knows her own mind. After reading this passage, I realized that although I was over halfway through the novel, I never really knew Jane until that moment.Anyway, while this may be a long excerpt, it's well-worth the read:---------------------------""I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me-because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction-because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady-because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her-because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.""There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;-the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.""Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character-watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity-this guardedness of his-this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects-this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever- torturing pain arose.""---------------------------.....Jane's pain came not from any imagined self-deficiency ... because as far as she was concerned, the pretty Miss Ingram was an empty satin dress---not worthy of jealousy or anything else. Least of all Mr. Rochester. Hence Jane's pain. The mere fact that he would go for a vapid boob like Miss Ingram was the root of Jane's torment.Hard to be jealous of someone you feel is intellectually and spiritually beneath both you and the man you love. This is why I love Jane as a heroine! While not a raving beauty, she has a quiet and unshakable confidence that's very appealing. No wonder Mr. Rochester fell for her.Writers, if you want to see how to create a compelling heroine, look no further. The lesson is in this book!Suffice it to say, Jane Eyre is my all time favorite heroine.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my all time favorites,I have loved this book every since I first read it back in high school.

You cannot help but empathize with Jane and relate to her on many levels.,positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of the greatest books of all time,"This book takes the reader on such a moving and satisfying journey. After many tears and many times laughing out loud I just finished the last page. I wish it hadn't ended, and yet the story is perfectly whole. I'm already estimating how long it will take to digest it so that I can read it again. It gets a little slow in the latter third, yet wraps up so beautifully that it's all worth it.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,2.0,"You've Come a Long Way, Baby","The secret to enjoying Jane Eyre is to read the first two thirds, and then stop. If you ignore that advice, you might conclude that a woman&#8217;s ideal role is something akin to slavery: total submission to the other gender.Yuk!The two men Jane involves herself with are certainly egomaniacs. Perhaps I&#8217;ve gone too far&#8212;maybe they&#8217;re just maniacs. Maniacs that Jane is more than willing dedicate her life to. The eccentricities of their personalities don&#8217;t bother her at all. What was Bront thinking of?A comparable near contemporary female character is Lizzie Hexam [Our Mutual Friend (Dickens, 1864-65)]. Like Jane, Lizzie was strong. Like Jane, Lizzie submitted herself to a dominant male, Eugene Wrayburn. Perhaps a significant difference is that the man Lizzie served, if not a perfect human, was worlds more appealing (at least to me) than either Eyre&#8217;s Edward Rochester or St. John Rivers.The last third of this book is all the more disappointing because of the quality of the two thirds that preceded it. Jane began as a woman with intellectual curiosity and strength of character. The life and future she ends with are anything but hopeful.",negative
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Timeless Classic,I have seen most all of the movie versions of this book however they can never compare to the complete novel. Read this and get a truer feel for the characters in this story. Will keep you engrossed to the end. Great story well written.,positive

It is poignant and unforgettable. It is one of the few novels wherein the author speaks to the reader as if he or she is a dear friend and this is a story she simply must tell. I love it. It is bittersweet, mysterious, and a little supernatural. I wish it had been required reading in high school.... thankfully, I picked it up and read it on my own. Highly recommend it.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Masterpiece,"I was shocked to see that many of the people who reveiwed this book gave it one star. It took me two days to read this book. I could'nt put it down! Jane is so down to earth and she refuses to feel sorry for herself, and do what she wanted to do the light of what others would suffer if she did. Her devoted love to Rochester was touching. When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right. Charlotte Bronte book is the best I've ever or ever will read. Those who rate this book 1 star need to reread it.:)",positive

But, I soon found out that I was wrong. Jane Eyre will awaken your senses and will leave you feeling like you know the characters. Unlike other books Jane Eyre is a book about intelligent decision making and moral. I feel that this book deserves another look at I hope that others will enjoy reading it as much as I do. By Heather Beers",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Turbulent, intense, and passionate.","Jane Eyre is one of the most beloved books ever written. Before I had read it, I attributed this to the many movies made of the plot, because I did not think a novel written in formal style by an author often paired with Jane Austen would appeal to the general public. I read it. It was as formal as expected, but different. There was imagination here, like a butterfly on a string, and the contents were Truth. Real Truth is interesting and thought-provoking no matter how presented. The style is a lot like Jane herself: a passionate, creative, romantic young woman, though shy and refined, introspective, rather plain, well brought-up and having strict, if select, morals. This may be in part due to the fact that the novel is written in first person, with Jane narrating. Jane is an incredible character; every word, every action, every thought makes sense, enhances and makes more real her being. All of the characters in Jane Eyre are this detailed, and all are completely different from the others, lending comparison essential to the reader's opinion of each, and of what Jane should do. Although some find the dialogue a bit improbable and fancy -- that no one speaks that way in real life -- I only had problems with that when acting it out. Admittedly, dialogue is at times long and too polished to be spontaneous, but the content of the spoken words makes up for it, and this type of dialogue does not dominate the entire book. Rapid, witty exchanges are just as common.The plot is original and dramatic; keep in mind that Jane Eyre in Ms. Bronte's day might be like Stephen King or Danielle Steel in our day. Jane Eyre is, essentially, a masterpiece soap opera, though a very elegant and refined one. It is a story of characters afflicted and tortured by the rules of society and the self-deprivations of morality and piousness. It is melodramatic and emotional, but not to the point of sogginess; crisper, tenser parts balance the sentimentalism. Suspense begins right away, but continues with something of a snowball effect, reaching its height near the end -- but this is only my opinion; many disagree with me. The one fault with the plot (I had no complaint, but it is my way to accept everything in a good book as Law) may be the frequent coincidences. Giving examples would spoil it for those who haven't read the book, but all contribute majorly to the plot, and all just cross the line between probability and unlikeliness. Critics have softened their accusations with the fact the Ms. Bronte believed in her coincidences, and had likely seen them happen.As a writer, Ms. Bronte is an virtuoso. She uses nearly every tool of the trade: extensive foreshadowing, including prophetic dreams, false suspects, symbolism, effective tense shifting, character analysis from a single point of view, and so much more. It is no surprise that the manuscript of Jane Eyre was accepted and published overnight, and became an immediate success. It is still a success a century and a half later, and as fresh and tangible as it always was. Reading Jane Eyre is an experience you cannot deprive yourself of. I would begin today.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Poignant and Touching!,"Jane Eyre is a beautifully written masterpiece! Bronte uses eloquent language to convey a timeless love story. The book was moving and profound, and I thouroughly loved it. I suggest it to everyone. It is a book not to be missed.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Well Written Governess Romance,"At first glance, this book seems like the story of a lower class woman winning the heart of a rich and of a higher tier man. However, there is much more to the book than just a passionate romance. In addition it has been linked to have influenced Henry James, the author of The Turn of the Screw, also about a governess falling in love, but with some messed up consequences... sorry for the tangent. Anyways, Jane Eyre really is good, as Charlotte Bronte mixes Gothic elements with romance and focuses on a dynamic character who undergoes a bildungsroman and matures at the end of the book.Set in London, England, a stereotypical place for love, Charlotte does well in establishing the imagery of the fire between Mr. Rochester and Jane. She constantly uses colors to set the mood and uses it to set off feelings. Mainly, she appeals to our sense of cold and hot, to paint Jane's emotions, it is wonderfully aesthetic and should be a good read to those who enjoys language.Not only is her plot above average, and her literary devices superior, she is able to meld the two together flawlessly for those who love to read for storyline and those who enjoy a good analysis on what they read. By now one should get the tone from me that Jane Eyre is not your average romance novel. It is more than that. It also speaks of moral responsibility. This centers around the two protagonists love, as Rochester is still married, and kept it hidden. When Jane finds out, she is caught in a dilemma between her principles and her feelings. Unable to figure out a compromise she runs away. Only when Rochester redeems himself by trying to rescue his wife from a fire is he then able to prove to Jane that he has changed and is a candidate for her love. Conveniently, his wife dies in the fire, and Rochester is left crippled, but not permanently. This represents his forgiveness; he has repented for his sins and is now able to be married. The story ends with their marriage and Jane Eyre's epilogue.Charlotte Bronte is a very good author, able to appeal to both kinds of readers. With her brilliant use of figurative language, making Jane's decisions seem ever more desperate, and diction, which contributes to the overall gothic mood of terror, most readers will be enchanted by her work. However, it is also this aspect that makes the book lack it's wow factor, because it appeals to both, it does has to divide it's attention between plot and device.I would recommend this to anyone who has not read the book yet, so what are you waiting for? Go get it!",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Intense Emotion,"True, the first few chapters are difficult to get through,but after those this story brought out tons of emotions in me.I felt ashamed when Jane heard the ladies talk about her in the game room with Mr. Rochester there.I felt shunned when Mr. Rochester brushed Jane aside seemingly without a second thought.And I felt the romance in the garden.Not to give away any more, I will just simply state that I felt some emotions that no book has ever brought out so fervently in me.This isn't your classic love story..boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. There is tragedy and heartache on the sides of both characters.There isn't just the longing of one or the heartache of one, you see each,longing and heartache, in both.The characters are put into such detail and described so well you can almost imagine what they will say in response to other characters in the book.This is a truly unique book and if you like feeling angry,fearful,mourning,loss,and romance this book is for you!When I first started it,it really was not that interesting to me, and it actually took me two times to go check it out before I eventually got past the part I didn't like.So if you bear through the beginning you'll eventually get to the really good stuff...oh, and one more thing. If you have seen any of the movies,don't go by them.Of the movies I have seen based on this book,none live up to the standard set by the book.I hope this was helpful:)",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Brilliant and Better than I remember,"I absolutly loved this novel. It does not matter how long ago it was written or how much time has passed since I have read it. The characters are interesting, well-developed, and exciting. I had forgotten about how Jane Eyre's childhood was such a struggle. She experienced mental and physcial abuse at the hands of unfeeling and wicked relatives. Later in the story when she is &quot;left&quot; at a &quot;school&quot; her life is again that of a sad and angry child. Somehow through it all she manages to become a affable, caring, and trustworthy adult. This assures her not only a position has a teacher at her school but later has a governess to a child in the care of the intimidating and wealthy Mr. Rodchester. What a formadable opponent she was has an adult to Mr. Rodchesters wit and saracasim. The end of the book is full of surprises and twists. I hate to sound cliche but it is true. Once a classic. always a classic.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,It's worth the time,"I'm almost 13, and my mother and I just finished reading this last night (we were up until midnight...couldn't put it down.) It was a really wonderful book, although there was a slow spot or two. Jane is heroic and good, but not sappy. I loved her witty conversations. You can't say you've read the classics until you've read Jane Eyre.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,longest historical romance i've ever read,"Loved it! I read it in seventh grade. My English teacher gave it to me as a present and I have cherished it since. I still have that copy, in good condition. The novel was wordy and yet not boring. The book to me was not only a classic but beyond what words can describe. I'm in 11 grade and I've read it about five times. I still cry whenever I read it.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Wonderfully Wordy and Worldy Classic...,"This classic (yes I coin the phrase out of my own true feelings about the book - not because it is old) sincerely touched me and found me out to be a romance reader after avoiding such themes as much as possible. The book, extremely unique in style, speaks across all time and place - THAT is why it is a classic. One of my favorite tools that Bronte uses is the way she adresses the reader as 'reader.' It gives the uniquivocal sense that you are sitting in the room with her as she tells this tale to you of a little orphan girl (or could be boy) who seeks out her destiny in fortune, misfortune and fate. The only fault that she perhaps could have avoided is in editing. There are a few strange grammatical quirks and there are many lines that could have been shortened or cut out entirely. However, I highly recommend it to any reader of any age with an open mind to start and finish a true CLASSIC.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Metaphoric Life Story,"Jane Erye, by Charlotte Bronte, is an excelente book. The characters are very well developed. Jane, for example, expounded upon the world her naivity and youthfullness. Her character was that of a dew-kissed lilly-- clean, pure, and forthright. Mr. Rochester was very similar to a bull dog. He had a surreptious character that leaves you wondering about his motives. His growling countenance intimidates and frightens the reader. This book contains numerous metaphors for life-- hardly ostentatious, so the reader must infer to discover these valuable lessons to life. A classical must read, Jane Eyre is not a dustcollector for any bookshelf. You will read it multiple times, appreciating it more as you get older._________________________________________________________________*Note: There is a slight part which may put the reader to sleep. Still, it is definitely worth reading.",positive

Jane is a wonderful woman with strong character and a inquiring mind. She reminds me slightly of myself.Many people seem to shun this book because it is so old and speaks in a slightly different English than we are used to. It is not a hard read at all.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,One of my absolute favorite books,"Jane Eyre was orphaned into the care of her cruel Aunt Reed as a baby. After years of being emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins she was finally allowed to go to school. However going to school didn't improve her standard of living much. Jane began to feel that there was something else out there for her so she took a job as governess at Thornfield Hall. Everything was going well until she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I just really love all the characters and the dramatic plot twists. A lot of people who read this book just think it's a romance novel. While it is true that Romance plays a large part, the book is much more than just your run of the mill romance. People who are able to get the `just a romance novel' idea out of their heads will see that the book is more about a woman trying to find a better life against great odds.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Jane Eyre: Old, but not quite over the hill","Jane Eyre may seem at first to be a boring 19th century novel, but in truth it is a fantastically rich book. There are so many great aspects in the novel. The characters are developed very well. Even though the author was limited in her knowledge because as a woman she was limited with education, each of the characters is portrayed well enough that he/she becomes real in the reader's mind. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the women characters are more developed and are more various than the men characters. The men in the book are shown to use women and they are not as diverse, but they are still interesting and realistic. Another great aspect is how well the author intertwined themes of social and financial classes, feminism, and faith and philosophy. Some of the ideas are easy to see without having to think about them, such as how money creates the biggest separation of classes. However, some of the philosophical ideas in the book are much deeper and harder to see and comprehend. The ideas are also not from our time period and are, therefore, harder for us to understand than they were for the readers of the author's time period. For example, the idea of how nature protects us and watches over us to make sure the right things happen to us at the right time is a intricate and remarkable concept.Jane Eyre does have one major flaw, though, and that is the plot. It is an interesting plot and easy to understand, but it is too much like a fairytale. Everything works out almost too perfectly, and seems to be coincidental. The plot helps the theme of how nature makes sure things happen, but it is too planned out. One almost expects to see the all too typical line, ""And they lived happily ever after"" at the end of the book. This flaw with the plot would only be seen by readers of our time because we are use to reading books with multifaceted plots, whereas in the time the book was written, people were happy just to read such a developed novel. Even with this flaw, still, it is a great book. While Jane Eyre won't go on my favorites list to read again and again, it was definitely a novel worth reading.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,A Timeless Love Story For All Hopeless Romantics,"Set in England of the 1600's Jane Eyre's life story is told through her own perspective, aging throughout the novel. Her thoughts and feelings from early childhood through where she is in life writing the book are told with a grace that comes only from life experience. Jane Eyre is from the time of her earliest memories an orphan. In this book she finds love, acceptance, and herself. Charlotte Bronte's talent for bringing out all sides of a character is shown well in this book, she leaves nothing to be desired as far as rounding out her characters. Such characters as Mr. Rochester who first shows Jane true love, Mrs. Fairfax who helps her to understand her equality to others, and Adele Varens who helps her remember childlike wonder as she goes through her life changing experiences, all play a part in Jane coming into herself. This book is an inspiration and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.Attention was drawn to the dramatic separation of the classes during the time the book was set it. Jane Eyre is an orphan, and therefore frowned upon by all as a dependent and a burden, almost no one expects her to do anything valuable with her life. This remearkable young woman pushed for the right to be sent to school, then ater her graduation stayed on as a teacher, after a mentor and only tie to the school left she advertised herself out as a governess. This was by no uncertain terms a grand achievement for someone born of such a position in the world. Although a governess was not the highest position during her time, she made due with the job and eventually found another window of opportunity. She fell in love with the master of the house and was asked for her hand in marriage. Certain events delay this already unseemly arrangement before true happiness is found.Many readers and critics alike have compared this story very closely to Cinderella. The plots are similar, however, they are not quite the same. Jane Eyre, born an orphan, falls in love with her version of &quot;Prince Charming,&quot; coming to her in the form of an employer. This idea of romance found in hte most unlikely of places with the most unattainable of people is a common thread through many modern works. This kind of fairy tale is appealing to a broad audience and almost any age. However, the level of reading that Jane Eyre is written for would suggest an age group of 12 through adults.This novel left me both uplifted and very impressed with the style of writing that Chalotte Bronte has. The novel's use of separation in social classes to cause a stir and engage the reader's attention to the romance of Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is brilliant. Most people would say that the book is a basic take off of the age old tale of Cinderella, but in all actuality it is a beautifully mastered knowledge of the romantic ideals of many young women. I would remcommend this book to the age group of 12 through adults, this novel is also geared mainly towards women, although it would be a wonderful read for those men in the world who have a taste for this genre. Over all the book was a success, a literary masterpiece that has forever more left it's mark on our society as a classic.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,It made me love to read!,"I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Depth unimagined,"Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel.

I cried like a baby when Jane was torn between Mr. Rochester and her values, and intended to leave. Then again, I cried in Tarzan so I'm more emotional than most.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Re-thinking Mr. Rochester,"I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the ""mad wife in the attic"". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of ""hero"" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. ""Jane Eyre"" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Most Romantic Book Ever!!~,"I first read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; when I was entering my sophomore year in high school. I was so fascinated by the beautiful language, expressing the love between Jane and Edward Rochester. I love Edward so much, because he is human. He is depressed with his life, and wishes for another. He searched for another, taking any and every risk he needs to...even adultery or bigamy. His love for Jane is deep and real, as is her love for him. This classic hasn't lost it's details, details about hope, love, and dreams, in the some 150 years since it's been published. I still enjoy it, even after reading it about 100 times!!~ I consider it the greatest love story ever written.....a story that defies the stuffy rules and regulations of 19th century England. It just shows that love can be more powerful than anything. With that, I give this story 5 stars....only wishing I could give it all the stars in the world. Why? Because it deserves that!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A great classic,"I read this book in high school because 'I had to', it was required reading. I hated it. But when I got older, and could read at my own pace and place, the book is one of the best mysteries ever written. I can't imagine going to a horrible school like Lowood, but perhaps that was preferable to living with her Aunt Reed, a most disagreeable person even unto her death. I cried when she and Mr. Rochester could not get married because of the 'house secret'. She seemed to have such a hard life anyway, that was icing on the cake, or de-icing if you will. The book flowed smoothly and I even managed to get past the 'true English'. I've always had trouble reading English writers, but Charlotte Bronte is an exceptional writer. I like when she addresses her audience, &#34;Reader, you would not believe this but...&#34;, etc. As I said it's a great mystery, and autobiography, but I don't want to say more to spoil the story! Chance it to say, if you've only read the book because, 'you had to', read it again in a new light.

Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students. Girls who gravitate toward love stories with sweet sentiments might find the tale of Jane Eyre more enjoyable than others who are not such romantics.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,I am Jane Eyre,"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre is the story of a young orphaned girl, raised by her uncaring aunt. Jane is treated less as a part of the family, and more of a servant in her aunt's household. Dragged into the room of her uncle's death, for fighting with her cousin John Reed, and suffers a mental breakdown. Doctors suggest that Jane be sent to the Lowood Boarding School for Girls. The school proves to be of little comfort to as she finds that the conditions there, under the brutal Mr. Brocklehurst, are barely an improvement on her living conditions at home. The school embracing the poverty as way of life and the girls barely getting by was completely under the thumb of Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane's only relief from the burden of hardships at the school is her dear friend Helen, a kind young girl, who imprints in Jane a measure of Christian patience for the pain, which she has endured in her childhood. An outbreak of typhus prompts many of the girls to leave, but Jane to remain as a teacher at the Lowood School. To expand her horizons, she accepts the position at Thornfield manor, caring for the sweet, French ward of the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite her best efforts to the contrary, Jane falls in love with her employer. What secrets lie in Thornfield manor? Why does Jane often feel like she isn't getting the whole story? As Jane begins to realize that things aren't as they appear in Thornfield, she is forced to leave the manor, her young pupil, and Mr. Rochester behind. But can she stay away from her true love for long?Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who was born on 21 April 1816. In 1824 Charlotte and her sisters were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. Within a year her sisters died of consumption and their father removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. The critical depiction of the school at Lowood in Jane Eyre drew on Charlotte's experiences at Cowan Bridge and her eldest sister, Maria, was the inspiration for the character of Helen Burns. In 1847 she published Jane Eyre under the pseudonym of Currer Bell. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls and died shortly after due to complications with pregnancy.Jane Eyre is definitely a book everyone should consider reading. It helps define some many things including: love and independence. The entire time Jane pulls you on the emotional roller coaster of life. You go up and down with her through her love of Rochester. This book brings you into it so quickly that before you know it you are crying at the end too! And that's the kind of book you want, the kind that makes you feel like there is nothing quite as beautiful as the relationship between the characters. This book inspired me to read more from the entire Bronte collection.",positive

The notes in the back, however, did just that - I was hoping they would explain a few things that I didn't understand (old usages, etc), but they just notes about how Bronte was referencing other works or about how there was something that showed up later in the book as well.This book is a classic that's remained popular for a reason, though.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,"Very moving, captivating story","That person who said he/she wasn't going to read it because it looked &quot;dry as hell&quot; is missing out on a lot. While the first couple of chapters are somewhat boring, after that the pace never flags, despite the 500-odd-page length. Many chapters in the book are very intense and moving, and it is not too hard to feel for Jane. I thought she might be a very righteous, prim-and-proper person, but was surprised and delighted to discover that she's very flirtatious with Rochester once they declare their love, and playfully delights in her hold over him. Their conversations are fascinating and very revealing. It is always clear that she is passionatly in love with him and no one else, but still more than willing to leave him once the &quot;terrible secret&quot; is revealed. While not quite as strong and feminist a character as I expected, she nonetheless does show an iron will and desperate desire to do what's right more than once. When someone in the book was talking about a Mr. Rochester and made it sound like he'd died, my heart literally stopped for a minute until I (and Jane) realized the man was talking about Rochester's father. That was near the end, and by then I'd become so caught up in it I really couldn't put it down. It is not just a romance novel for women; I'm a 13-year-old boy and I enjoyed it immensely.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The best classic I've ever read,"I finished reading this book about a week ago, and I've never been able to get it completely out of my mind since, particularly the wonderfully charismatic and passionate Mr. Rochester. (I'll get to him later, though) This is only the second novel I've read that has a main protagonist that is quite similar to me in personality, which is refreshing in itself. (Most novels have spirited, strong-willed people as the main character--not that it's wrong, it just gets boring after around 500 readings.) I identify with Jane because in many ways, for she acts and reacts as I would in her situation. And Mr. Rochester....I fell in love with him with the first chapter I read (which was Chapter 27; I cheated) and have not stopped since. *Sigh, Giggle*These characters are so brilliantly drawn out--no other classic has done a better job of making me feel as if these characters are dynamic people.The prose sparkles--especially Mr. Rochester's, who I find has the gift of turning me into a pile of mush.In short, this is the best classic I've ever read, and the only one that I will definitely read over again and again and again.....(The only one that came close was Pride and Prejudice) No other story has made feel as this one did--this gothic story of passion and love captivates me and will continue to do so.P.S. The only problem I had with Jane's character is when my darling Edward is singing to her, and she is fairly unaffected. I was sobbing on the floor and yelling at Jane at why she was not doing the same thing. Any one else feel the same way?PPS: Some people might say that she is strong and strong-willed, but she is not. Rather, she is strong-principled. She does not have to have her own way, but when it comes to God's way, she is more spirited about it.PPPS: And I am not Dwight Rhodes. I'm his daughter.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"Remarkable Novel, Remarkable Character Studies","Since it was penned by Charlotte Bronte in 1847 (under the male pseudonym of Currier Bell), Jane Eyre has been adapted to the screen several times, including a beautiful BBC Television production scheduled to air soon on PBS, and a musical. I even seem to recall an abridged comicbook version of Jane Eyre. I read the novel when I was 12 years old and was so inspired by it that I read it over many times that year, and never, never forgot it. Interestingly, I am now reading it for the first time since. I have little to add to the other reviews here, but recommend this book to everyone! The author develops Jane's tremendous character, childhood to young adulthood, with economy and care. The early chapters of the book are both painful and lovely to read. The love story that follows is passionate and terribly hard fought. Told in the first person, much of what I experience reading this book, due to our author's skill, is not written on the page, but felt as my own experience. And Mr. Rochester is, if possible, a more brilliant revelation this time around. He is completely compelling and magnetic, humorous and desperate, and sympathetic. The book also provides a portrait of how life was at that time, by the aristocracy and the common man. I have edited this review to add my advice that if you have never read the book, whether or not you have seen any of the film versions, choose an edition without an added ""forward,"" or save comments for last, so that do not encounter spoilers and can form your own impressions.Reader, .... read Jane Eyre!",positive

It sure doesn't have to be, though, if you read from a larger perspective.To fully appreciate today's world, it helps to understand the attitudes and experiences of the past, and JANE EYRE is one of the novels that helps us understand.The book takes an orphaned girl taken in by an unloving aunt, and follows her into an unhappy school experience and ultimately into as good a career as a woman of that time and station could hope for, that of governess.Well, this is one of the earliest gothic novels and true to the genre, you know the girl's going to fall in love with her employer who, unfortunately, has a deep and dark secret.There's tragedy of sorts here and there's triumph, all told against the mores of a bygone era. There's much to learn and to enjoy here if you open up to it. It is dated, and not 100% relevant to today's life, which is why I give it four rather than five stars.It may be helpful to read and compare JENNA STARBORN to JANE EYRE. The former pales horribly by comparison, but by setting the story in the future, today's reader may gain a better understanding of the original story.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Must Read,"I will be honest, the first fifty pages of Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are tough to get through, the story moves slowly as Bronte sets up the plot and introduces us to many of the major characters. I will get back to this in a minute...&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; tells the story of Jane, who is orphaned as a child and must live with her terrible aunt, who decides to send her off to Lowood School in order to learn discipline. Jane is unlike other girls, she describes herself as plain and boring and after leaving Lowood, she decides to take on the job of governess at Thornfield Hall.This brief synopsis is all that happens during the first part of the novel, but after this, Bronte creates a story that is mesmerizing and full of intriguing symbolism and a surprise plot twist at the end that was completely unexpected. I loved Bronte's play on names: Jane Eyre, Helen Burns, Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall, etc. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are at once heartbreaking and romantic, including my favorite scene in the garden (the details of which I will not give away).It's easy to be tempted to give up on 'Jane Eyre' because of the slow beginning, but once Jane begins her job as governess, the novel comes alive as Bronte weaves the intricate plot that is full of joy, sorrow and bizarre occurrances.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A true gothic romance.,"A true classic, I found an old copy in my mothers house and devoured this book one hot summer. It has been made into several motion pictures, the most recent of which being in 1996 starring William Hurt.The heroine of the novel, Jane Eyre, ends up in a strict boarding school after her parents die and her only living relative, and aunt, can no longer stand her 'wickedness'. She endures hardships at school, and the school mistress tries to dampen her passion and opinions.Jane does not lose her spirit, she merely hides it behind her plain face and grows into a proper lady of her station. She graduates from school and takes on a position as a tutor for a young French girl, the ward of a Mr. Rochester. She is given a room in his large house the likes of which she has never seen in her former spartan existance. She falls in love with the little girl as well as Mr. Rochster.Rochester is hiding a tragic secret however. One that he kept from Jane and everyone else for many years. The truth is finally exposed and Jane is heartbroken. This, however is not the end of our tale. Their love does not die, and the end of the novel is poignant and romantic. I guarantee it will have you in tears.Charlotte's writing is beautiful, moving, and descriptive. She is unmatched as a mistress of character development.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Male and loved it!,"I just read in the second-to-last review that the reader (from suburban D.C.) never met a man or a boy who liked this book. Well here's one! I am 23 years old and have just finished it for my literature class, but it's not unprobable I would have read it otherwise anyway, sience it is a classic. Anyway, I first of all think it was very well written with a fluent language. The main reason why I enjoyed it so much, though, is because of the way the writer seems to understand and symphatise with her characters (which are all very real), even for the ones that have faults she condemns. You might think I, being a man (or a boy), could not identify with Jane, but in many ways I could. Maybe because Charlotte Bront is so superb in making her literal world coming alive, that I almost feel I'm there myself, or maybe just because Jane Eyre is the kind of person you'd want to be.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre is a plain woman in looks, but her intelligence, strength, and feistiness make her a heroine who I think gives much-needed justice to women of her time. She is a spitfire who makes you want to know her and hear her story, and she tells it in a clear, first-person fashion that makes it an easy story to read.Orphaned at a young age, Jane is sent to live with her aunt and cousins, who abuse Jane physically and mentally for ten years. Eventually ejected from her aunt's household on false charges of thievery, Jane is then packed off to Lowood, a charity boarding school whose conditions were deplorable; students were scarcely provided with food and clothing (think Oliver Twist), and were regularly terrorized by the school's cruel headmaster. If that weren't enough, Jane's only real friend at Lowood dies during an outbreak of Typhus.Fast-forward eight years - Jane, still nearly penniless after a two-year stint as a teacher at Lowood, ventures out to make a life for herself as a governess. Her charge is a precocious French child named Adele, with whom she develops a fast friendship. But the real story of Eyre lies in her relationship with the child's foster parent, Mr. Rochester, the dolefule, aloof, yet passionate and somewhat mysterious master of Thornfield. Despite their differing castes and the 20 years separating their ages, their feelings for each other grow deep, and they decide to marry. But it doesn't go exactly as Jane had planned - their wedding ceremony is stopped when it is revealed that Mr. Rochester is already married - to a madwoman whom he has kept locked up in one of Thornfield's bedrooms for years!Horrified, Jane flees Thornfield, ending up a beggar on the streets because she spent her entire savings to leave. Eventually taken in by a clergyman, St. John Rivers, and his two sisters, Jane makes a new life for herself as a teacher. During this time, Jane finds herself the sole heir of her father's estate. Soon after, St. John proposes marriage to her repeatedly, but Jane finds his cold demeanor lacking in comparison to the man she truly loves, Mr. Rochester. (She also finds out that St. John is actually her first cousin - a staple of this genre, it seems.) Prompted by hearing Rochester's voice calling her name during a prayer for guidance, Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find it burned down, and Mr. Rochester blinded by the fire his wife set before killing herself. Naturally, Jane and Mr. Rochester live happily ever after, but if you think this is merely another sappy love story (which I am no fan of!), you would be wrong. In Eyre, Charlotte Bronte shows us a depth and realness of characters which you would be hard-pressed to find in any other novel.Do yourself a favor by reading it - you'll understand why it's considered one of the finest examples of English literature.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Greater than its reputation,"Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to ""Reader, I married him"" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.'",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,There is nothing plain about this Jane...,"""It is best to be yourself, imperial, plain and true."" Robert BrowningAnother chick Brit classic that I had been eluding since my teen-age years and finally got around to perusing this past month. In all fairness to our fellow reviewers who panned this one, I wouldn't have enjoyed this when I was in high school (nor even in college for that matter) either and would have needed a dictionary along with a barf-bag if I was required to read it back then. I have no idea why teachers continue to shove such classics as this down their student's throats when the great majority of their budding brains, inexperienced hearts and raging hormones make it virtually impossible to fully digest at such an age. However, that is a topic better tabled for another time...To describe this beautiful work as simply a love story would be doing it a grave injustice. While it is arguably one of the greatest love stories ever known in literature (I actually prefer ""Jane Eyre"" over her younger sister's classic ""Wuthering Heights""), it is so, so, so much more than that. This 1847 masterpiece is an important history lesson as well on what it was like living in provincial England way back when. It touches upon such common themes as morality, religion, gender relations, Social status, friendship, education, etc... A story such as this can relate so much more about the past than most text books will ever tell us, while at the same time making the whole learning experience a joy as well.Of all the past heroines I have had the pleasure (or sometimes the disdain) of being introduced to through my literary travels, it is almost impossible to think of one that possessed a bigger heart and more passionate soul than C. Bronte's Jane Eyre. I found her to be much more interesting and even brighter than James' Isabel Archer, without the latter's pretentiousness. She is way more down-to-earth and less judgmental than Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. She is much more grounded and has a much stronger backbone than Hardy's Tess. However, what really separates her from all the other heroic belles of invention is simply her burning, incessant quest to find love and to be loved in return. Not just romantic love, like Flaubert's Emma B. and Tolstoy's Anna K. but REAL sustaining love, the kind that brings value and a sense of belonging. The sincere kind that comes from not having to sacrifice (as the above mentioned did) one's own principles and ethics. It is this noble and true love that never dies or withers, because it is genuine and magnanimous, without any kind of contrivances whatsoever. Jane never sold out and held steadfast to her beliefs and values, and in the end, well... you'll have to discover that on your own!You don't need me to rehash the book's plot. You can read other people's reviews to do that. All you need to know is one thing - if you haven't had the pleasure yet of meeting Ms. Eyre and you love literature, then please do yourself a favor and order this one today. If this isn't a five-star classic, then I'm afraid I don't know what is!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A book about feminism much before this was a fashion,"Concerning on English classic novels `Jane Eyre' has a special place in my heart. This was the very first classic novel that I ever read in English. As I needed that for an exam, and didn't have enough knowledge for reading the original I was supposed to read an abridged version. And so I did. And I loved the book.Years later, I decided to read the real thing, the original novel. Much to my surprised it turned out to be highly accessible, and as entertaining and a nice read as the abridged version. Moreover, in the original book I could find all the details, and were able to savor Charlotte Bront's language.Written more than 150 years ago, `Jane Eyre' reads as fresh as a XXI Century novel. Bront's use of language is vivid and remarkable. Her descriptions bring the book into life. We cannot forget that the book is the social portrait of the women in the writer's society. It shows how they struggled --and failed most of the time-- to reach a respectable position in the society.Jane didn't have any attractive that was required in her time. She wasn't rich or even beautiful, although smart. But smartness wasn't a good thing for a woman in those days. She is even punished for having brains. She ends up being a governess, and end up having a humiliating experience, being forced to change places and even name. Ms Eyre is only noticed when she receives a heritage and becomes rich. And she does not let all she has suffered affect her.`Jane Eyre' is a novel ahead its time. This book is about feminism much before the term was created. When Jane speaks to her aunt about her rights --can you imagine a girl speaking about her rights in that time-- she is doing what other women would do years later. Charlotte Bront has managed to creat a strong and sad girl, who is trying to find her place in the world. With that, the writer made a book that will be read for generations to come --even if they read an abridged version before reading the unabridged book.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Hard to put down,"This book, like my title says, was hard for me to put down. I just became so inthralled in the book and its characters.You become, early on, compassionate to Jane's pain, hopeful with Jane's encounter with Mr. Rochester, afraid for her when she meets with a ghastly face, and so on and so forth.At times I almost didn't want Jane with Mr. Rochester, but in the end he won me over. Their love is unique, it was very nurturing and longing, but love nonetheless.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story with a little suspense all throughout.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A classic,"I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,4.0,Jane Eyre - just trying to find love,"First of all, I would just like to say that Jane Eyre is most likely a good book for all those bookworms out there. I am postive that you will not be disappointed with this book if you like classical and dramatic novels. Yes, the novel may seem to be a little long, but it keeps you interested and guessing to the very end. Don't get me wrong, it is not some book that is a mystery. Although, the end is very unpredictable and I had no idea which path Jane Eyre was going to take.When I opened the first few pages of this book, I must admit that I was questioning whether or not this was going to bea dull and drab story. It seemed as though this might be a challenging book to be able to finish. Although, after some questioning, the plot took a turn for the better. The story really started to pick up as I began to enter the life of the orphan, Jane Eyre. The uninteresting beginning was well worth reading because the story was really good.This story begins with Jane Eyre living with her mean Aunt Reed and cruel cousins. She goes through awful torments like being locked up in a dark room all night. The beginning of the story kind of reminded me of the enchanting story of Cinderella. Jane is then sent off to school all alone in the world to become a well-educated lady. She thinks she begins to find happiness there, but some awful things happened. She then goes to Thornfield Hall to try to be a teacher. She actually ends up falling in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. Jane once again begins to feel that everything is going well and that she actually might have found true happiness. Jane and Mr. Rochester are then about to be married when an awful secret is revealed about Mr. Rochester. Jane then has to figure out whether to stay with her one and only true love or just move on to a different life and forget that all of this happened. Jane then does take a small journey away from Thornfield to find out where to go from there.I found that this book contained mystery, drama, romance, andeverything else a person could ask for in a book. This book is the type of book that you would want to take and curl up in bed and just keeping reading it to the very end. There was great detail about the life that Jane Eyre and all the feeling she felt were revealed to the reader. I seemed to really be part of the story and sometimes forgot where I was. There were also some amazing twists in the story that kept me guessing about who did that or why is that women so suspicious. There was also many characters that kept the story alive and interesting. Although, once and awhile it did seem as though the story was confusing. Things were being said and I was not quite sure who was saying them and places I was not quite sure what was going on. Although, with some of this negativism, everything else made up for it. All and all, it was a really good book. For me, it seems to reflect back on today's life. All Jane was doing was trying to find acceptence, love, and happiness. It seems at this day an age, that all people are trying to do is find true love and someone to be there. For this reason, I think that many of you would really love this book and read it. The novel is well worth the reading. I am sure that once you began the story that you will just want to keep reading it to find out if Jane really does find what she is looking for and if she finds true happiness. Now it is you turn to go to your library and check out this great classical novel that you are just going to love.The grade I would give this book would be about a low grade A because sometimes it was confusing. Highly recommended for people who like drama and romance.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Truly a classic - read it more than once,"Reading Jane Eyre for the first time, I was engulfed in the novel itself: the characters, the plot, and the setting completely draw the reader's attention and make it difficult to put down. The second time, I read it slower, paying special attention to the characterization, something Charlotte Bronte is terrific at, and the various details that I may have overlooked originally, but which add to the general enjoyment of the novel. The third time, I read Jane Eyre for the language - Bronte's style is captivating: every word, every sentence has a beauty within it that a reader wouldn't want to miss. I read it, again and again, because her words made everything seem new and exciting no matter how often I read them. The explicit descriptions, the prolonged narration, the time she takes to develop the charaters - everything creates a novel that one can read over and over. This truly classic work of literature appeals to so many different emotions and strikes the fancy of probably anyone who can appreciate great writing.",positive

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Great Gothic Romance,"This is a beautifully written book about the life of Jane Eyre, a poor but spirited girl, and her transformation from an impudent young girl to an accomplished lady.My favorite part of this book was the beautifully written (and gradually developed) romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre.",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A wonderful love story.,"After reading this story, I feel safe and sound, a large genuine feeling. Because this story is so sweet, not only from the love story of Eyre and Rochester is delightfully fresh, also I learn a lot from Eyre, she is strong, brave, independence, honest and friendly, I think she is a public notice of nowsday's women.Eyre is a orphan whrn she was a child, but she never give up herself, I think many of Hong Kong people must study from her strong and face to their life, after reading this book, they might have some encouragement.The most touching part of the story is the love story.I think it is wonderful! Eyre and Rochester have many of wave, althrough their love is not allow from those common people and Eyre once wanted to give up her love, but Rochester still love her deeply, I feel thouched after reading this book.This book tell us what the true love is, I have learn a lot from it and I really love it!",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,Jane Eyre,"I decided to read the book after seeing the 1996 movie version. I heard that the 2011 rendition was great and I wanted to have more insight before reading it. After seeing the movie and loving it, I didn't think the book could get any better.The book starts out with Jane Eyre in her youth. She lives with her aunt and cousins. Unlike families should be, they mistreat her and are abusive to her. Her aunt, claiming that she is a wicked child, sends her to a catholic school. If you thought things were going to get better, you thought wrong. She is still mistreated and shunned by the residents of the school. Jane Eyre grows to be a woman of strong opinions and independence. In adulthood she does not grow to be a woman that is handsome, in fact she is very plain. But she believes that intellect and personality are what really make a person. When she advertises as a governess, she is immediately answered. She arrives at her place of occupation and begins well enough. There are strange things that occur in the house however, for instance, strange laughing and disappearance of objects. It's troubling, but she hardly minds it. After some time, Jane begins to become closer to the master of the house, Mr. Rochester. He's mysterious and different. But in the end, will it be for nothing?The narration and the way the character conducts herself is what really makes this such an incredible read. It's a very unique style in which the book is written. The words are very fluid and it wasn't at all a difficult read. I was stunned with the beauty of the book and how much I loved the book. I have no criticisms for it. I very rarely have no criticisms for a book, but this is truly a masterpiece.",positive

I couldn't put it down and called my Mom and told her she was right, I should have read these in high school.So, now I'm working on reading some classics between reading newer material!I loved this so much that I ended up buying a soft cover version to add to my library.I would highly recommend this to any of my friends...",positive
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A sheer pleasure,"I think I read this book during middle school or high school but it left a much deeper mark reading it as an adult. Jane's character is inspiring and refreshing in today's world where strong female role models are scant. I so enjoyed following Jane's journey into adulthood, and took away much from her self-reliance and integrity. This is now easily one of my favorite books, because of the wonderful characters and the eloquent writing (The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is another of my favorite books, for the same reasons).",positive

I cannot say anything about it which hasn't been said already. I just wish when kids read it for the first time, they would truly grasp how very ahead of their time Jane Eyre (and Charlotte Bronte) were. The romantic in me was just spellbound by the intensity of Rochester and Jane's love for one another. A thought that repeatedly crossed my mind was ""Has anyone ever loved anybody the way Rochester loves Jane?"" If you read it as a teen, go back and read it with adult eyes. I found I appreciated it in a whole new way. I cannot recommend it highly enough and would heartily give it 10 stars if I could. I am off to find the movie version now...",positive

I'd seen the movie not long ago with Cirran Hinds and it was really good. Although, now that I've read the book, the movie doesn't do it justice, they left out much of Jane's experience at the school and at Gateshead.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,A Timeless Classic,"It was my first time reading this classic and truly loved this book. The first quarter of the book was a little slow to get into. Afterwards, I could not put the book down. Jane and Mr. Rochester's love story is one of the best from the classics. The climax and the final reveal are certainly worth the hundreds of pages. We can learn from Jane's journey from an orphan girl to an independent woman even today in the 21st century. Definitely not a Cinderella story but that's probably what makes it so great to read.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,"""I need not sell my soul to buy bliss""","""I need not sell my soul to buy bliss""Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, ""Gone with the Wind""! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, ""Wuthering Heights"", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",positive

I had also prided myself on never having read recreationally anything that could be considered literature that wasn't required for school. I started Jane Eyre with the attitude that I'll read it until I get bored, then stop. I didn't get bored. Charlotte Bronte created a masterpiece that kept me enthralled from start to finish. There was crime, passion, mystery and women's rights rolled into one effort. For the era in which it was written, Jane Eyre was an amazing book showing a woman of intelligence and strong character.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,5.0,The Bronte Masterpiece: The Best Edition,"Written in 1847 by the woman writer Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre remains a classic of 19th century literature. This novel was one of the finest of its time and what made it all the more incredible was that it was written by a woman. Charlotte Bronte and her sisters, the Brontes, were British women who grew up in Yorkshire, the English countryside. To kill time when they were bored in the domestic and boarding-school ambiance, they wrote great works of literature. It's a must read for young women, but also for men and young males (preferably in the high school or college level) Jane Eyre is ultimately a literary novel and only a literary-minded intellectual can truly enjoy it for the masterpiece that it is. It ranks among the greatest works of English fiction, taking its place with the other male greats- Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Curl up, warm up some tea or coffee, put on some mood music and read this incredibly engaging book. In this edition, we get commentary and preface by noted scholars.Jane Eyre has been scrutinized time and again. It is understood by many that the heroine Jane is Charlotte Bronte herself. It's partially autobiographical in some portions- Charlotte Bronte did grow up in lowly conditions and was in boarding school that was cold and freezing. Charlotte did love a married man who was older than her, though nothing came of it of course. Jane Eyre, a feisty, spirited young orphan, is taken away from her home where her wicked aunt and cousins mistreat her. She is taken to a boarding school for girls until she comes of age. She lands a job as a governess for the eccentric and mysterious Mr. Rochester, who is hardly ever at home and takes care of his daughter Adele, teaching her to read and write, etc. But the mystery surrounding Mr. Rochester's past becomes a present reality in Jane Eyre's own life. Furthermore, Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre fall in love. A novel that is inspired by Gothic fiction, it is strewn with Gothic, supernatural and suspenseful atmosphere and symbolism. The tree that is struck by lightning is a warning for Jane Eyre to leave Mr. Rochester's mansion, the strange cries in the attic later turn out to be Mr. Rochester's first wife, the crazed Bertha. A fire destroys the mansion and Mr. Rochester ends up diabled and blind. Bittersweet though the ending is, Jane Eyre and the blind Mr. Rochester marry and live happily, after much water under the bridge. This novel is a long read and should take up at least a whole summer, but it's very worth reading. It's a classic. Time and again, it will appear on the list of reading material for high school and college courses. And a bit of advice- dont' just read it to pass a class, get into the story. You will score even more points.",positive

I was always waiting for something exhilarating to occur, but itnever did. If Jane Eyre does seem interesting, I suggest renting themovie, it isn't half bad because many of the tedious parts of the novelwere cut out. I felt the novel was too descriptive, and made you fallasleep.I suggest this novel to someone looking for something to putthem asleep, or maybe someone with insomnia.

B000PVCBBU,Rain Village Signed,5.0,Timeless & Masterful: Run away to the circus,"I read Carolyn Turgeon's 2nd novel, ""Godmother"" before reading this, and upon finishing it immediately got ""Rain Village"" at the library. Turgeon's writing is incendiary, unlike anything else I've ever read. Reading this book is like watching a vivid movie, and I hope someone will find this gem and make a film out of it, that's how good it was.The book is split into 3 sections of Tessa's journey, and each one is an amazing tale. I won't go into the description of the story, as that can be found in the amazon description. The entire book centers and swirls around the character of Mary, who is enchanting and secretive, though you only get to know her thru Tessa's eyes, as well as the stories Tessa hears about her. I liked this book even more then ""Godmother"", though still found myself wanting just a little more story, as the ending seemed rushed.

When Mary Finn comes to Oakley, the town is abuzz, the men lining up to take out books from the library where Mary stands behind the counter dispensing volumes of prose and poetry, their wives seeking readings from the magical woman with black gypsy curls who understands the deepest secrets of their hearts. Soon Tessa falls under Mary's spell, enraptured by her stories of distant people and places, Mary's home in Rain Village, the circus life and the broken heart Mary seeks to hide. Through Mary's generosity, Tessa's world grows to include a future and the possibility of her own success in the circus, all the wounds of her past healed by Mary's ministrations.Upon Mary's suicide, Tessa is set adrift; she runs away from home to join the Velasquez Circus, where Mary's name is the secret key to another family, one who will love and protect, not harm her. Tessa marries a handsome tightrope walker, Mauro, of the famous Ramirez Brothers, content with her life in the air for the next few years until a stranger, Costas, appears at the circus searching for Mary. Suddenly, the present falls away and Tessa is inexplicably drawn to this striking man, leaving all she loves behind to travel with him to Rain Village and make peace with Mary's memory.Part fable, part fantasy, written in the otherworldly prose of a vivid imagination, Rain Village is an allegory for the mysteries of life, the search for identity and the cruel realities of a father's misspent love for his daughter. Turgeon has created an enchantment, filling the reader's head with the fevered imaginings first stirred when Tessa meets Mary and finds her irresistible, the lure of circus life, the romance of marriage to the devoted Mauro Ramirez, even the foolish quest with Costas, the young man of Mary's stories come to life before her astonished eyes. Although there is a sense that Tessa has built her life on Mary's dreams, she must finally choose the direction that is meant for her alone, leaving Mary to the past.Framing all in the luxurious language of mystery and dreams, Tessa's journey is filled with extravagant sights and sounds, the ugliness she endures transformed by the magnificence of her accomplishments and remarkable spirit. These characters exist in the realm of the imagination, where love is freely given and richly rewarded. From the trapeze hung from the dark ceiling of the book-laden library to the breathtaking top of the circus tent, from the Ramirez estate in Mexico, where the earth's bounty surrounds the performers preparing for the next circus season to the pungent dampness of Rain Village, this extraordinary novel propels Tessa's daily struggles into rarified air where anything is possible, even contentment.

The hints of magic-realist hyperbole elevate this survivor's tale, heightening the mystery of what links ambition to tragedy without making the story in the least bit nebulous, encouraging readers to give in already and submit to wonderment.",positive

B000PVCBBU,Rain Village Signed,5.0,fine early twentieth century character study,"In Oakley, Kansas, tiny twelve years old Tessa Riley is so small she is unable to help her parents or her three normal siblings with the farm. In fact her mother insists that Tessa do one job, stretching exercises so that she would grow to a normal size and no longer be a freak. Tessa feels all alone as everyone in the community and her family following the leads of her abusive father and bible quoting mother treat her like a pathetic sideshow reject.The new librarian Mary Finn has all the townsfolk hopping as she enchantsthe men with her beauty and the women with envy. Mary especially takes a liking to diminutive Tessa telling her tales from her days as the flying Marionetta with the Velasquez Circus. She teaches the child to read and tells her enchanting tales about the residents of Rain Village. Tessa uses the stories to hide her hurt from the scorn of all (except Mary who encourages her) and the sexual assaults of her father. When Mary apparently commits suicide, a distraught now sixteen years old Tessa flees to Kansas City where she joins the circus and marries flyer Mauro Ramirez until her late mentor's nephew Costas arrives and tells her he is going to Rain Village.Though the ending is unwisely rushed, RAIN VILLAGE has a Brigadoon like feel to the wonderful historical tale. Tessa may be short, but she holds the coming of age tale together as she is a fully developed character whether she is preadolescent, teenager, or adult. Mary is more mystical in nature (like her village and the circus) adding to the overall enchantment.

B000PVCBBU,Rain Village Signed,4.0,"""For people like you and me, the world is different""","Twisting and curling and jumping high atop the Velasquez Circus big top, Tessa Riley has come along way from her sheltered life as the reticent girl growing up in the small town of Oakley in rural Kansas. Yet the vestiges of her old life still remain, steadily haunting her, and deep down she knows that she must reconcile her new world with the life of Mary Finn, her mentor and the woman who once inspired her.As Rain Village opens, the sixteen-year-old Tessa is working on her parents' farm. The family comes from a long line of farmers, whose lives have been controlled by the seasons, but Tessa doesn't fit into this hardscrabble life of constantly digging and hauling crops. Desperately wishing for more, her longings are sparked by the arrival in town of Mary Finn, the new librarian, rumored to have a wild gypsy past and secret lovers who visit her after the library is closed.Despite whisperings from the townsfolk and from her sister Geraldine that Mary makes everyone crazy, Tessa gets a job at the Library so she can get closer to this strange and mysterious woman. Whilst Tessa's mother brands Mary a jezebel and the library an unholy place and her abusive father bans books from the house, Tessa ignores them, giving herself over to the books ""raging with life around her,"" and to Mary, seduced by her kindness, her beautiful words and stories, and her tarot cards, herbs and tea leaves.Tessa soon leans that Mary was once a circus artist, who left this life she had loved so much to retire to this silent town, to quietly catalogue books. She also discovers that Mary once ran away from a place called Rain Village, leaving her mother, father sister and everything she'd known, after her lover William tragically drowned. Mary tells Tessa that she's not like the others around here and that there's a world a world larger than any of them could imagine out there, just waiting for her.Determined to learn the art of the trapeze, Mary mentors Tessa, teaching her how to spin circles in the air, clean and sharp as a knife cut. She tells her ""her body was born to fly."" Undoubtedly, the girl has a natural talent, her body driven completely without barriers, and as fluid as water. ""It was like flying - like having no weight around you, no bones, no skin like melting right into the air.""After sudden tragedy strikes, Tessa is forced to follow her dream of joining the circus, to find a world brighter and more wonderful than anything she could find in Oakley. Off to Kansas City Tessa goes, her life suspended between lives, between grief and freedom, the excitement of being out on her own and to be adventurous, free from the burdens of family and of love. Tessa takes to circus life like a fish takes to water, fascinated by this strange and wonderful new world she sees around her.There's the man who can swallow ten swords and blow streams of fire from his mouth, the girl with the wings sprouting from her back, the pure white horses sparkling with rhinestones, the boom of the ringmasters voice, the grown of the Ferris wheel and the colorful banners, and the glare of lights turning the world inside out.But it is the trapeze artists which most attract Tessa - the beautiful and exotic Lollie Ramirez and Carlos, Paulo, Jose and Mauro, the handsome and gentlemanly The Flying Ramirez Brothers who inspire Tessa to whirl around a white rope and cut cleanly through the air, moving around and around, unaffected by gravity and anything of this earth.In perfectly considered prose, author Carolyn Turgeon pounds the reader with exacting images as Tessa's beautifully crafted journey is bought to life. Tessa does indeed fall into the life of the circus and even becomes one of the company's star attractions, but Mary's painful past emerges - and haunted by the images of William in the river pale and floating, ""and the girl who cried so many tears"" - Tessa finds herself facing many unanswered questions about her best friend's painful life.Reassessing the past in the light of the present, Tessa gradually changes, maturing and growing, somewhat driven by blind faith and a hope and a longing that has made her demand more of the world than at first it wanted to give her. Part of Tessa's growth is that she realizes pretty soon that Mary has given her a beautiful gift, a striking talent and a language that can describe feeling and beauty, and perhaps even love.Weaving together the inscrutable forces of memory, spirit, desire and regret and imbedding her narrative with magic and dream-like qualities, Turgeon has written an exquisite and quite moving account of one girl's search through history in an effort to fill the holes that nothing else can reach, to search for happiness and to hopefully discover the ultimate truths that mysteriously surround her dear best friend.

B000PVCBBU,Rain Village Signed,5.0,Magical Masterpiece!,"Little Tessa Riley is a tiny, diminutive twelve-year-old girl who barely stands four feet tall. She was born with hands the size of small plums and fingers like star fish. She is far too small to help on the family farm harvesting corn and potatoes. Tessa can't even hold one large potato with both hands. Her mother, father, sister, and two brothers, all think she is a freak. They call her mean and hurtful names like: munchkin, tramp, and black-haired Jezebel. Her mother forces her to hang from a curtain rod for hours on end hoping it will stretch her little body so she'll be less of a freak.Her father is a loud, gigantic man who likes to Lord his power over those who are weaker than he is. Her meek mother runs around clutching rosary beads but isn't even Catholic, and is bent over the table reading her Bible every night.Tessa had heard there was a new librarian in town who seemed to have a strange affect on the men, her own father included. After lunch one day, Tessa decided to get down from her ""stretching rod"" and run her way to town in hopes of seeing this woman without getting caught by her father.Sitting on the front steps of the Oakley, Kansas City library, Tessa was trying to decide whether she should go inside or not. She looked up and there was the most beautiful woman she had ever seen and the woman was looking right at her! The woman had striking blue eyes, brown freckled skin and long, wavy, shiny black hair. Mary Finn, the librarian, turned her cat like eyes on Tessa and invited her into the library with her. Tessa was thrilled. Once inside, Tessa thought Mary smelled of: ""...the spices my mother baked oranges in."" Her wrists were adorned with jingly bracelets and she wore a long flowing skirt.Mary chatted with Tessa for a bit and Tessa was so endeared to her that she ended up spilling her guts about her terrible home life and body stretching to Mary. Mary felt so sad for little Tessa and made her a special blend of her tea and promised to teach her to read and write. Before she left that day, Mary had taught Tessa how to spell her name. Tessa watched various women from town come in disguised to talk to Mary secretly about their problems, they believed she was a witch with magic powers. Mary would read Tarot cards and send them home with a small cloth bag filled with special herbs and spices to help with their particular problems. When Tessa left that day to return home, Mary was worried what Tessa's father would do if he knew where his daughter had been.The following day, Mary told Tessa that she used to be part of a circus which made Tessa's eyes go wide. She was part of the ""Velasquez Circus"" from Mexico, and they were famous. This new news only endeared Tessa even more to Mary, especially when she learned that Mary flew on the trapeze!That evening in bed Tessa was bursting at the seams just dying to share this new knowledge with someone. As she lay in her bed she decided to confide in her sister, Geraldine, after making her promise that she wouldn't tell anyone. Geraldine was totally excited as she knew who the Velasqueze Circus was because they had come to Kansas City the previous year. Geraldine told Tessa that she thought Mary looked like a princess. Tessa replied that she did too, and wanted to be just like her! Geraldine began a cruel laugh, a horrible guffaw, telling Tessa that she could never look like Mary Finn because she was far too ugly and a freak. Feelings of shame enveloped little Tessa and she hid under her bed covers for the rest of the night listening to Geraldine still snorting in laughter.Mary and Tessa became fast friends well into Tessa's teen years. Mary finally hired Tessa to work in the library with her. They shared joys, sorrows, and secrets until a terrible tragedy occurred changing the course of Tessa's life forever as she runs off to join the circus!You won't believe what happens to little Tessa from Oakley, Kansas once she finds the circus.

B000PVCBBU,Rain Village Signed,3.0,Rain Village,"Tessa Riley is a very small 12-year-old living in a Kansas farming village with her very tall family. Her parents are very religious and don't think that Tessa or her siblings need to know anything besides how to farm land and sew. But Tessa is so small that she cannot help with the farming. So instead, she starts working with the new librarian, the sexy and fascinating Mary Finn.Mary helps Tessa find herself, discovering a deep core of strength and self-esteem. Mary teaches Tessa to read and tells her stories about her home, Rain Village, and her stint as an acrobat in the Velazquez circus. These hours with Mary help Tessa deal with difficult conditions at home, but eventually Tessa must set out on her own. She does so, escaping to join Mary's former circus troupe and making a home for herself there. But even after making a new life for herself, she finds she can't quite keep the old life out.Turgeon is excellent at description. She makes Mary come alive, giving her flowing hair, a beaming smile, and a scent of cinnamon and cloves. She shows just how lonely Tessa feels, completely ill-at-ease in her skin and depressed about her future prospects. She describes circus life and Rain Village in great detail. And I think she does very well with the ""magical realism"" aspect, as though strange and wondrous things just happen and do not cause anyone to so much as blink. I felt so invested in the story and in Mary and Tessa.But then, about 200 pages in, it just stopped working for me. Tessa felt a deep bond with Mary and when the two had to separate, she was deeply affected. But after Tessa made a wonderful, happy life for herself in the circus, she kept claiming that her old life would never leave her. That she had to have ""closure."" I also thought that, compared to Tessa and Mary, all the other characters seemed a bit one-dimensional. We know that the circus people are beautiful and vibrant, but we don't really get to know them well enough. Tessa claims to be in love with her husband, but I was unconvinced because I didn't know her husband well. I didn't feel sympathy for her compulsion at the end of the book (quite rushed in about 50 pages) to find out more about Mary because she seemed to have gone years without mentioning Mary to anyone.While I think Turgeon used wonderfully evocative language and I enjoyed her use of magical realism, this book ultimately fell flat for me. I felt disappointed that I was so invested at the beginning, but at the end felt that no real resolution had been reached.",neutral

0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),5.0,How inevitable the wheels of unkind fate,"Faulkner is not everybody's cup of tea, but he happens to be my favorite American writer. While the critics and all those ""best books of the century"" lists consistently feature ""The Sound and the Fury"", ""Absalom, Absalom"" and maybe ""As I Lay Dying"" as Faulkner's major works--and I too like those books--I have always thought THE WILD PALMS a gem. An underrated, forgotten gem. Perhaps it really isn't his best novel, but still it is a work of genius. I recently re-read it.Very few novels on the world stage are composed of two completely separate stories. THE WILD PALMS consists of 1) a love story in 1938, taking place in New Orleans, Chicago, Wisconsin, Utah, San Antonio, and the Mississippi Gulf coast, and 2) the story of one man (a prisoner) and his mighty ordeal during the Mississippi River floods of 1927. Parchman State Prison in Mississippi is the sole physical point that joins the two tales, otherwise separate in time, place, class, and impulse. But Faulkner's genius is such that the reader soon understands that the theme of both stories is the same. Faulkner's novels often focus on Fate, how the individual is caught in mysterious, giant webs of `outrageous fortune' beyond comprehension, helpless to oppose the powerful, hidden currents. The present volume is no exception. ""You are born submerged in anonymous lockstep""--the main character of story #1 muses on page 54--""with the seeming anonymous myriads of your time and generation; you get out of step once, falter once, and you are trampled to death."" In the first case, Wilbourne and Charlotte deviate from the usual path for love's sake, strive mightily to maintain and cherish that love, and pay an inevitable price. In the second, a convict is caught in a flood in a tiny boat when sent to save two people. He rescues one, but is swept away. He completes his mission, returning both boat and rescued woman, despite incredible hardships, only to face a certain ironic destiny. In both cases, other lives or other destinies constantly present themselves, but the protagonists refuse to alter their selected course. It is the antithesis to the Hollywood message that ""you can be whatever you want in life, you just have to want it badly enough"". Faulkner plumps for Destiny. A person might be, he says on page 266, ""...no more than the water bug upon the surface of the pond, the plumbless and lurking depths of which he would never know..."" one's only contact with such depths being when Fate is blindly accepted and played out to the bitter end. The forces of Nature, symbolized by the wild clashing of the palm fronds in the winds off the Gulf of Mexico, always outweigh the strength of human beings. The palms clash in the wind at the beginning and at the very end as well. Faulkner concludes that bearing grief, living with it, is better than suicide, better than obliterating the agonies of remembrance with a pill or bullet. Memory, however, bitter and painful, is better than nothingness. The two main characters end in prison, a most un-optimistic metaphor for life. A most powerful novel, a novel that speaks from the crocodile-haunted deeps of every person's psyche.",positive
0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),5.0,"If it doesn't have punctuation in the title, it's not really Faulkner","I supposed this was not a major work because I hadn't heard about it before. Nope, it's major. The most popular form of this book is to rip it in half and such that Old Man is by itself as a short novel. That's really a shame. Old Man, is a rollicking story of a man swept away on the Mississippi during the flooding of New Orleans in 1927 (Hoover's deft handling of the crisis is a large part of the reason that he became president). However, the story doubles its power when it is juxtaposed with the story of two lovers flooded out of civilization by their aching need for each other. You get two uncontrollable forces of nature, both horrifiying to encounter, and both demolishing the prisons within which the protagonists of each story are previously held (let's say the medical career path of one, and actual prison for the other). A primary question in each is whether it's better to be back in the prison or not, and there's a strong case for yes in each.Both stories are good, but what makes this spectacular is simply the fact that the experiment is attempted. Who does things like this? There's a thematic link between the stories, but it's fairly loose. However, the back and forth interspersion paces the stories perfectly. In non-stop presentation, I think the tone of either of these would be too much to take. As it is, though, this is actually a page turner. More impressively, these aren't two stories that were slapped together (a la the Golden Slumbers medley (God forgive me) or Scenes from an Italian Restaurant) but were written at the same time after a major heartbreak. There's also the greatest two word last line of any novel that I'm aware of. I won't spoil it.This isn't a great introduction to Faulkner, but it's a fantastic example of why people who love him love him. Milan Kundera singled this one out, maybe not as a favorite, but as a book that should be more highly recognized. I couldn't agree more. Faulkner has the problem of too many masterpieces. At this stage of his career, it's hard to ignore any of them.",positive
0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),5.0,A Great Introduction to Faulkner,"I love this guy Faulkner. I read another half chapter of The Wild Palms on the train.Never read anything by him before.Faulkner's characters don't sit around and examine their navel. They just Do. Yes act on their passions they Do. His characters are not beautiful people. They have scars, injuries, poverty, depraved morals, injustices, suffering upon suffering. What makes the Wild Palms beautiful is the passion of people living life right on the bone.A married woman is planning on abandoning her husband and two kids and running away with another man. The other man asks her what about her two kids. On page 41, she answers, ""I know the answer to that and I know that I cant change that answer and I dont think I can change me because the second time I ever saw you I learned what I had read in books but I never had actually believed: that love and suffering are the same thing and that the value of love is the sum of what you have to pay for it and anytime you get it cheap you have cheated yourself."" No Catholic saint-mystic ever said it better. Pretty good for a crazy Protestant drunk.You hear talk about stream-of consciousness with James Joyce and Jack Kerouac and so on. This guy Faulkner captures the way our minds think and our mouths talk more realistically than anybody.Of Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor said, ""Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track when the Dixie Limited is roaring down.""Something about this book reminds me of the Stephen King material set in the south, the Southern-ness of it and the same kind of characters.The omniscient author technique is frowned on in serious, modern literature. I don't knw if this aesthetic rule post-dates Faulkner, but he uses it to no ill effect. There's very little difference between when a character is speaking and Faulkner is speaking. It gives the effect of us reading the characters thoughts rather than Faulkner telling us what they are. It works perfectly.Few to none of the characters in any of the standard, best-seller type books have any inner life. When most of the authors try it, they are quite pathetic at it. I suppose that's because the authors have no inner life themselves. Faulkner does not show us the inner life of any of his characters either. However, as Faulker presents his characters, the reader induces their inner drives from their actions. It works very, very well. Stephen King's characters are like this also.Stephen King by the way is very steeped in American literary tradition. Essentially, he's New England gothic. He is to Nathaniel Hawthorne what the Frankenstein, the monster, is to Dr. Frankenstein. King is clothed in Hawthorne, bathed in Faulkner and inebriated with Poe. To look at the connection further, I suggest you read the short stories of Hawthorne.",positive
0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),5.0,"Buy it, read it","This is the 4th or 5th Faulkner novel I've read. I think it should be better known. The tile of the novel is important, The Wild Palms: [If I FORGET Thee, Jerusalem]. Memory is an important theme of the novel. Pay attention to it. ""The Wild Palms"" is a New Testament parable, of sorts. The other novella, ""Old Man,"" is an Old Testament parable. Escape is an important theme. Wilbourne (=Will Born, Still Born) and Charlotte travel to New Orleans, San Antonio, Chicago, etc. trying to escape. From what? From whom? On the flip side, the convict can't escape, he's a convict. But he gets an opportunity to escape in the big flood (Noah) but doesn't. Why doesn't he try to escape? Charlotte should be compared to the woman with child the convict ""saves"" in the flood. Abortion is a theme. Mysogony may also be a theme. Is it? Willbourne is weak, Charlotte is strong. The convict is stupid--his girlfriend, is she smart, in a calculating way? In the end, is Faulkner obliquely saying the wrong people ""hooked up,"" that Willbourne should have ideally met the woman who has the baby, and the convict should have met Charlotte, who in the beginning of the novel just want to ""escape"" with Willbourne?If you keep the above points in mind as you read the novel, perhaps it will draw you in, then you too can drown in the flood of myriad meanings and multiplicity of inferences. Overall, a good, if not great novel. Dark, brooding, nihilistic--very tasty, though! Enjoy!!",positive
0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),5.0,"""The Wild Palms""--used as a meditation by Thomas Merton","This book was recommended to me a few months ago by Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk who died in 1968. How this happened is as follows: I was looking through some book cases in the back of a local Catholic church, when I found some audiotapes of lectures given by Thomas Merton to monks in training during the early 60's. I had read his biography, ""The Seven Storey Mountain,"" and wanted to hear his voice and get an idea of what he was like. I listened to many of his tapes--some were good, some not so good--but one of the tapes, titled ""The Deluge,"" was particularly interesting to me. It discussed how the monks could use the writings of William Faulkner as inspiration for meditation on the eternal Truths of the human condition. Most of Merton's discussion was about Faulkner's book ""The Wild Palms."" I recommend Merton's tape ""The Deluge"" for those who want an interesting perspective about this book.As for my comments about this book, I believe it is one of the most pro-life books I have ever read, particularly with its theme of abortion in ""Wild Palms"" contrasted with the theme of the birth of a thriving infant during the flood in ""The Old Man."" Also, this book shows that you never know where you will encounter virtue. The convict displays great virtue in ""The Old Man"" while the modern, educated people in ""Wild Palms"" show an obvious lack of it.In summary, if you liked ""The Wild Palms,"" you should listen to Merton's tape, ""The Deluge."" You can probably still get this through the Merton Society.",positive
0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),5.0,"Evocative, intense, beautiful","I bought this book many years ago in New Orleans, took it home, and tried to read it as written, with the chapters alternating between Wild Palms and Old Man, but I just couldn't get going with it. I put it aside, and picked it up again 15 years later, prior to another trip to New Orleans...just to get in the frame of mind/state of grace that New Orleans requires. This time I did what Faulkner did not want anyone to do. I read Wild Palms all the way through, and then Old Man all the way through. Each story is intense, and even reading them separately, I could feel the connections of theme, character, and tone.The ending of each is blunt, harsh, shocking. Read them as written, or read them separately, but read them.As an aside, 50 years ago I tried to read The Alexandria Quartet, faithfully buying each volume as it came out in paperback, but ""couldn't get going with it"". Someone told me a few years later to start at the end, with ""Clea"" and all would be revealed. I did as suggested, and went back then and read the whole quartet in order, and have reread it many, many times since. The moral? Whatever it takes to read great fiction, do it, even if it's not the intellectual or critic-approved way to do it.",positive
0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),4.0,Wild Loves,"I have to confess that it took me two years to finish reading this book, that includes two novel. But it was worth reading. The two stories are very deep and touching.The stories told in alternated chapters are about love, resignation and dedication. `Wild Palms' is about two lovers who dare to have a very deep and selfless relationship that leads them to madness and death. The other is called `Old Man' and it is about a convict that saves a woman from a flood, but it means much more, it is all about maternity and the old battle of Men against Nature.I like most `Wild Palms', but it doens't mean I didn't like the other novel. But Palms somehow pushed some buttons inside me. Many people complain this novel is too obvious, and after the second chapter you can predict things that will happens to the lovers in the end. Well, it can be so somehow, but what I think it is more importante here is how far they go and how they take their love affair so serious and passionate. Charlotte and Wilbourne are very brave . When reading I could see the tragic result of their love, but one cannot imagine what leads the to such an ending. `Old Man' also is about love, but a different kind. In this novel, the river is one of the main characters, subjugating men, but also meaning free will.All in all, it is a very dense novel, that tackles both about bizarre and lyrical sides of life. I don't think it is a kind of book for everyone, due to its difficult and deep subject, but some people will delight with Faulner's words.",positive
0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),3.0,"Of floods and ""hemingwaves""","Originally published in 1939, it was not until 1990 that readers were finally able to read this novel as Faulkner intended. Prior to the Library of America edition, The Wild Palms was published as two separate short stories (""Wild Palms"" and ""Old Man"") and the texts were not alternated as they are in the new edition; furthermore, this new edition resurrected Faulkner's original title for the work, If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem. To read the novel in both its manifestations is a strange experience. Read separately, the two stories are only marginally successful, have a number of loose ends and bare absolutely no resemblance to one another; read in the Library of America edition, the reader begins to see that the stories act as each other's counterpoint by juxtaposing the story of man battling society against man battling against nature. Neither man wins their battle and the theme of alienation predominates.Viewed from an elemental viewpoint, these two stories concern themselves with the basic struggle between man and woman. One has to really do some hard searching throughout all literature to come up with two male characters that match Harry Wilbourne and the Prisoner for pure unmitigated naivety and botchery. Harry is finishing the last few weeks of his residency at a New Orleans hospital when he meets Charlotte Rittenmeyer. He is putty in the hands of Charlotte (already married with two children) who convinces him to run away together to seek a notion of love that does not die and ""only leaves you when you are not good enough, worthy enough."" He is deluded, seduced and brainwashed by his aggressive lover and proves to be a complete failure. Much to Charlotte's chagrin, he does not fit in with the bohemian lifestyle she seeks and spends inordinate time worrying about financial matters and respectability; more importantly, his libido does not match that of Charlotte and he is continually being attacked by his sexually insatiable partner leaving him spent and questioning his masculinity. Although Harry is very close to becoming a doctor, he gives the impression that he does not fully understand the act of conception and birth control is haphazard; eventually Charlotte becomes pregnant which leades to Harry's most serious blunder.Whereas Harry is tempted by Charlotte and succumbs to a lifestyle of romantic platitudes and sex, the Prisoner, the main character of ""Old Man"", finds himself at the mercy of nature and trapped into caring for a pregnant woman he has saved from the great Mississippi flood of 1927. The event interrupted his all male existence as a convict in a prison labor camp, and exposed him to a wild world of devastating flood waters and destruction. His only goals are to survive, to protect the woman and child from death, and to fulfill his responsibiliites and oath to the prison officials to return with the rescued woman. Faulkner depicts the Prisoner as an insect floating on a raging river who has no control over his situation and only survives by his wits. There is simply no time for romance or romantic posturing. And even though he helps to deliver the woman's child and provides for their welfare, she is seen only as a burden and no romantic (or sexual) feelings develop between the man and woman. He only wants to ""turn his back on her forever, on all pregnant and female life forever and return to that monastic existence of shotguns and shackles, where he would be secure from it all."" The Prisoner is a simple realist - he harbors no romantic delusions and because he is dealing with the natural world he is able to succeed while Harry and Charlotte, living amongst their romantic delusions, fail. The last words of the Prisoner (now safely back in prison), which ends the novel, make it clear that he has had no second thoughts. ""Women, _____! (Faulkner's blanked out word of the earlier editions is finally printed in the Library of America edition!).Many readers have come to the conclusion that this is Faulkner's A Farewell to Arms. Indeed, there is a similarity between the names of the main characters in that novel (Catherine and Frederic Henry) and in Wild Palms (Charlotte and Harry) and some of the settings are similar: the lake and the snowy mining camp in Wild Palms, and the Lake Country of Italy and a Swiss chalet in Hemingway's novel. Also, the birth of a child leads to the death of both women characters. Faulkner even throws in a Hemingway reference in his novel. In a response to a toast, ""Drink up, ye armourous sons. Keep up with the dog"", McCord, a reporter friend of Harry, says, ""Yah. Set ye armourous sons, in a sea of hemingwaves."" But Faulkner is not one to spend much time sympathizing or sentimentalizing with his silly lovers. By interlacing one story of altruistic love with another dealing with survival in the real world, Faulkner lets the reader know where his feelings lie.I am probably short changing this work by giving it only a three star rating, but I feel that once Faulkner leaves the safe confines of Yoknapatawpha County his work suffers. It is as if, in an attempt to apply the themes developed in that mythological county onto a more cosmopolitan canvas, he is no longer working with the same palate, but with one with fewer colors and maybe bought in a Hollywood five and dime.",neutral

0394605136,The Wild Palms (Modern Library),4.0,When The Levee Breaks,"William Faulkner was one of the great American literary experimentalists, and ""The Wild Palms"" offers one of his most interesting ideas: Two interwoven stories, different in plot and theme yet linked by man's imprisoned condition.In the first, titled ""Wild Palms"" without the ""The"", we meet a staid internist who becomes a married woman's object of desire. After surrendering to a couple of cosmic twists, the two are carried away by passion to embrace a kind of loving doom.In the second, ""Old Man"", a convict is plunged into the middle of a major Mississippi River flood with a pregnant woman he rescues for company. ""All in the world I want is just to surrender"", thinks he, but Old Man River seems to have other plans.First published in 1939 as ""If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem"", this double novella famously namechecks another contemporary American author as ""Hemingwaves"". Others have noted how ""Wild Palms"" resembles two of Hemingway's better known works, ""A Farewell To Arms"" and the short story ""Hills Like White Elephants"". I believe they are right, and that Faulkner was also inspired by ""In Our Time"", Hemingway's first short-story collection which intersperses short stories with a running series of sequential anecdotes in breakaways that play off one another thematically. ""Wild Palms"" and ""Old Man"" do a similar sort of thing, if not as well.One problem is that of the two stories, ""Wild Palms"" is much better than ""Old Man"". We get in ""Wild Palms"" an unsettling erotic tale at once romantic and misogynistic, with the woman, Charlotte, a yellow-eyed Bohemian wannabe willing to abandon her husband and daughters for a man she doesn't really seem to love. She'd rather die than give up her freedom, to the point where death becomes a kind of objective, a kind of nihilistic declaration of indepedence.""You die anyway, but I had rather drown in the ocean than be urped up onto a strip of dead beach and be dried away by the sun into a little foul smear with no name to it, just THIS WAS for an epitaph,"" she says. Her lover Harry has more rooted survival instincts, but can't push himself away from passions he has been abjuring too long.The novella isn't plot-perfect, or at all sympathetic in its characters, but it keeps you reading. In the process it communicates some of Faulkner's most piercing ideas in language both sturdy and fierce.""Old Man"" is more often anthologized for some reason. I've come across it both in isolation and with ""Wild Palms"". It works better in the latter form, as a somewhat comic reprieve with more action than the talkier ""Wild Palms"". The unnamed protagonist of ""Old Man"" (they are all unnamed) is completely disinterested in freedom, to the point of being mortified of it. Prison is all he knows; his escape completely involuntary. The story moves doggedly from setpiece to setpiece, with much potential wasted. The pregnant woman seldom rises above a cipher.Some worthy observations and chuckles are weighed down by Faulkner's tendency to burden otherwise inarticulate characters with streams-of-consciousness as convoluted as calculus. At one point snakes are referred to as ""ophidian festoons"". That's a new one on me.Overall, ""The Wild Palms"" remains a rich, immersive ride. Even if it doesn't represent a return to his Yoknapatawpha County, both stories are partially set in Mississippi and as Southern Gothic as anything can be said to be. Faulkner fans will relish that distinctive burled voice of yearning and pain. More casual readers, meanwhile, will absorb and perhaps even enjoy the doomed-romance story for both its heady passions and its ruminations on the human condition, crystallized in one character's famous decision in choosing between nothing and grief.Something about the vitality of being alive keeps the characters in ""The Wild Palms"" afloat. The same thing keeps you reading.",positive

I found a massive concordance to this work, and it is in there, verbatim. People! People! This book! This book! I am 46 now, and first read Faulkner when I was in my early twenties. I read 3 of his novels before I was 25. They were: ""The Sound and the Fury"", ""The Hamlet"", and ""Absalom, Absalom"". Now more than 20 years later I finally get back to Faulkner; and it was this book. After two references to this book, in two different Jean-Luc Godard films: ""Breathless"" and ""Pierrot le Fou"", I had to read it. Moreover, I understand this novel is not highly thought of. In fact, when I was browsing through some criticism of Faulkner, I came across an essay: ""Faulkner's failures. . ."" Moreover, I have an New American Library edition of ""Sartoris"", and in the introduction yet another commentator disparages WP. But this is a good novel. I do not understand why this novel has been so maligned. Perhaps some of the metaphors are strained? Perhaps not. It is certainly worth reading again. And the story, the narrative is certainly not, I repeat NOT, strained. The characterizaion is phenomenal. I think the passages of the ""tall convict"" on the river are second only to ""Moby Dick"".

B0006AWY62,A modern view of geometry (Golden Gate books),5.0,"Easy to read, very clear, informative and inspiring","Far away and long ago, I read this little big book. I borrowed it from a public library, with the hope to learn plane projective geometry. I'm still amazed I could understand almost everything there in one month. Years later I bought it. The first three chapters are addressed to anybody able to read, write and think, with little or null background in mathematics. The book starts with a glimpse on Euclid's fifth postulate and his history. Then it gives an overview of elementary logic and says what an axiomatic theory is. In chapter three, Hilbert axioms for the euclidean plane geometry are presented. Here, the less trained reader could consider a trip thru Euclid's ElementsThe Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elementsbefore going further. If you have some mathematical education and keep faithful to Blumenthal, you face the affine plane and the problem of introducing cordinates (chapter four); to do so, Blumenthal uses a quite singular tool: Marshall Hall's concept of planar ternary ring (see the revered Hall's workThe Theory of Groups (AMS Chelsea Publishing)to confirm). I was shocked when I knew finite geometries were possible. The book shows that the plane admits the Desargues configuration if and only if coordinates form a (maybe non commutative) field of ""numbers"", while the plane admits Pappus configuration if and only if the field is commutative (G. Hessenberg's theorem). Next, an axiomatic definition of projective plane is presented (curiously, we don't find here the name of Staudt, the author of the first axiomatic system for the projective geometry, published in his book ""Der Geometrie der Lage"", N&uuml;remberg, 1847). More on coordinates and configurations on a projective plane is discussed in chapter six. At the end, there is a nice report on the elliptic plane, which is nothing but the real projective plane with a suitable metric (by the way, as a topological space, M&ouml;bius discovered that it is a non-orientable surface). Its differences with respect to the euclidean plane and with respect to the Poincar&eacute; half plane model of hyperbolic plane geometry are briefly presented. I regret that there is no bibliography, although many mathematitians are cited. What I appreciated most of this little book (in addition to its rich content) is the fact that it is both a model of mathematical reasoning and a very pleasant reading. Later, I had to study E. Artin's dry bookGeometric Algebra (Wiley Classics Library), where a simpler approach is used to introduce coordinates, and where the link between the projective geometry and the underlying linear algebra properties is quite well established, (with the so called ""Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry"", which essentially says that if coordinates are good enough, then evey transformation sending lines into lines arise from a linear map of a vector space underlying the projective space, a property which is not mentioned by Blumenthal). To be modern is nowadays much less important than it was in 1960. I don't know if the title of Blumenthal's work is still realistic. After Hilbert, between 1900 and 1970, many mathematicians felt forced to write their own books on the ""foundations"" of (projective) geometry. Among them, Coxeter's books are enjoyable, for exampleThe Real Projective Plane. Modern may be not, but Elie Cartan'sLECONS SUR LA GEOMETRIE PROJECTIVE COMPLEXE(""Leons sur la G&eacute;om&eacute;trie Projective complexe"", Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1950) deserves the highest attention.",positive

Nothing makes your skin crawl like finding a tick sneaking up your leg! DOH! Hard to squish, too!All-in-all, exactly what you'd expect from a Golden Guide. POCKET SIZED so you can carry it with you in your travels! Lots of nice artwork pictures, too. Again, this is NOT A DETAILED SPIDER SPECIES IDENTIFICATION BOOK. It's a good, general guide to help demystify the often overlooked and too often quickly stomped on spiders. Actually makes spiders seem a bit LESS scary and gives you a better appreciation for their place in the world! Of course they're still scary when those big brown, funnel-weavers that live in the basement sneak upstairs and run up your arm while you're lying on the couch watching late night TV! EGAD! Talk about making you JUMP OUT OF YOUR SKIN!Still don't know specifically what species the big red tick-like spider I saw was, but I DO know now that it WAS a COB-WEB weaver, related to those dreaded Black Widows (but BIGGER and not poisonous)! Oh, I DID set it FREE and didn't squish it!I'd give SPIDERS AND THEIR KIN FOUR STARS. It does what it sets out to do and does it well! Inexpensive and a great starting point if you want to learn more than the next to nothing you probably know. I learned a lot and gained a better understanding of spiders. I even learned the little jumping ones that I called zebra spiders because they have black & white stripes are really called Zebra spiders! Now I just need to get my magnifying glass to see if their eyes really are BIG like it shows in the picture!",positive

1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),5.0,"Gross but interesting, even to an Arachnophobe","Last week I woke up when a spider bit me on my forehead. It was a shallow, burning pain rather like someone had injected a weak solution of hydrochloric acid under my skin. About a third of my forehead was flushed red when I first looked in a mirror, but the redness subsided within a few hours, leaving a dime-sized lump that is still visible a week later.I used ""Spiders and Their Kin"" to tentatively identify the mangled remains of the spider as a small Brown Recluse (`Loxosceles reclusa'). Just in case I needed to go see my doctor, I put the spider into a baggie and froze it. Luckily, my forehead didn't dissolve---according to the Levis, ""In severe cases...the wound grows deeper and does not heal for several months.""At any rate, ""Spiders and Their Kin"" is a handy book to have around. I bought a copy for my sister when she found what she thought was a Black Widow in her garage, and I also got a copy for myself in order to identify the gigantic black and yellow spider that was hanging head-down in my Japanese Spiraea (it was---or maybe I should say, she was a Black and Yellow Argiope (`A. aurantia').When I first bought this book, just looking at the cover made me itch. However, it is filled with fascinating little tidbits about Arachnids and their kin. I used to think that Hairy Mygalomorphs were the ugliest spiders on Earth (most especially the ones with ten inch leg spans), but now my vote goes to the Pirate Spiders (`Mimetidae'). Luckily, they are small spiders (4 - 6 mm), so you would have to use a magnifying glass to get the full impact of one of these hairy little dudes.It is really rather impolite of me to make fun of `Mimetidae,' since they help beautify my backyard by eating other spiders. According to the authors:""Pirate Spiders invade webs of other spiders. The slow-moving Pirate Spider bites the web owner, which is quickly paralyzed and sucked dry through the legs, one after another.""Sounds like someone dining on crab legs.The only fault I can find with ""Spiders and Their Kin"" is that it doesn't go into enough detail on the individual species and subspecies of Arachnids. And that's not a fair criticism to make, since Golden Nature Guides are meant to be used for quick identification, not detailed research.Now, I've got to work up my courage, venture outside, and try to identify that big brown spider that has built her web from the house electrical line down to the clematis beside the porch door. Her abdomen is wider than it is long, she has striped legs, and she only comes out after dark...By the way, ""Spiders and their Kin"" has a useful chapter on `Collecting Spiders.' If you're an arachnophobe like I am, learning more about these critters might be the quickest way to cure yourself.",positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),4.0,Everything but the Hobo Spider,"One day I was walking down the hallways of the elementary school where I work; I saw out of the corner of my eye, something moving rapidly across the floor. The creature looked like it came out of a Star Trek movie. It was straw colored; had long tall legs; and two long feelers that I learned from this book are called: &quot;pedipalps.&quot; The pedipalps reached out in front of this creature like they wanted to pull something into its enormous jaws.I caught the creature, put it in to a bottle, and sat the bottle by my side. I scanned through the pages of &quot;Spiders and Their Kin&quot; and there it was. The creature turned from a Star Trek monster to a windscorpion: E. pallipes, to be exact. This relative of the spiders, I found out, is a voracious eater of insects and such. I figured if it would eat up the insects in my garden I'd let it go--and that's what I did.I gave this book a four-star rating, instead of a five star rating, for one reason and one reason only. Last November, my wife was bitten by a hobo spider. The spider was carrying a virus that gave my wife a disease called encephalitis. She almost died from the bite, but she didn't, and now she's nearly recovered fully.I bought the book, &quot;Spiders and Their Kin&quot;, hoping to find out more about the hobo spider (Tegenaria agrestis) but all I found were its cousins the &quot;European House Spiders.&quot; It would be nice if Golden Guide books would include the hobo spider in future printings of &quot;Spiders and Their Kin.&quot; After all, the hobo spider is here to stay.",positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),4.0,Extremely helpful for identifying those creepy crawlies!,"What this little guide to spiders lacks in detail it makes up for in ease of use. For any amateur arachnologist or just someone who wants to know what kind of spider (or other 8-legged critter) is crawling up their wall, this is an indispensable helper. The color illustrations are accurate, the information provided is adequate even for classroom use, and the number of different arachnids included is quite comprehensive for a book of its size.",positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),4.0,Excellent Pictures,"This book has excellent pictures for identification, however it mainly uses scientific names. There is also limited information about the spider or types of spiders that are pictured. I use this book for identification by the pictures and another book (National Audubon Society's field guide to insects and spiders) to learn more specifics about the spiders attitue and lifesyle. These two books compliment each other perfectly. There are also pictures of spider relatives and insects commonly thought of as spiders, such as whipscorpions, ticks, and arthropods. This book is excellent for a reference!",positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),5.0,What kind of spider is that?,"This was one of the first books I bought with my own money when I was a kid. I have since bought an updated version since most of the pages have come unglued in the old one (from use, not poor quality). Typical golden book illustrations, not photographs. Easy enough for a kid to use but filled with enough spider species for any adult to use. I have only found one or two spiders in my life that were not in this book.",positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),4.0,A Good Beginner's Introduction to Non-Insect Arthropods,"I was introduced to the early &quot;Golden Guides&quot; in the 1950s. My very first book on insects was in this series and I wore out numerous copies of the various titles. Of these I have always especially admired H. W. and Lorna Levi's &quot;Spiders and Their Kin.&quot; This little guide had (and to a large degree still has) the most complete systematic treatment of any of the taxa covered in the ""Golden Guide"" series. Few books were available on these fascinating creatures when this work was originally published and &quot;Spiders and Their Kin&quot; was a considerable improvement. The drawings of spider eye arrangements were especially helpful for identification.Unfortunately time does not stand still and the reprinted version of this book is somewhat behind in its treatment of spider families. There has been some attempt by St. Martin's Press to revise the classification (the sac spiders are shown to belong to several families), but some of the other families have also undergone major changes (e.g. ""Ctenizidae"" is now at least three families) and &quot;brown spiders&quot; (a name I really do not like- I prefer &quot;violin spiders&quot; as more descriptive) are now members of the Sicariidae. Neither of the last two changes made it into the revised book, either because they occurred after the corrected copy was submitted or because they were overlooked. The current revision does include the statement that urocteids and oecobiids have been united under the Oecobiidae - as it turns out, having a cribellum is a primitive trait and does not indicate relationships very well- but mistakenly indicates that the ""oecobiids"" are larger than ""urocteids"". It also still has the two ""families"" on different pages, so the revision did not include a rearrangement of the figures. In the scorpions there have been major taxonomic changes as well, but most of these were not noted (again several are probably just too recent to have been included). However, Hadrurus is correctly placed in the Iuridae, instead of the Vaejovidae.Because of these major developments I cannot recommend this book as an up to date guide to currently recognized spider families, but it still is a good starting place for those (especially young people) who would like to know more about arachnids, millipedes, centipedes, and land crustaceans. Fortunately many, if not most, of the families (e. g. Theraphosidae, Oonopidae, Salticidae, Linyphiidae, Selenopidae, Theridiidae, Araneidae, Tetragnathidae, Lycosidae) are still valid as described in the original edition of the book.",positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),4.0,A good little field guide,"Upon first reading, it is unfortunate that ""Spiders and Their Kin"" shows but a select few species from among the Arachnid pantheon, but it has been a great read and a great reference over the ten-plus years since I first purchased an earlier edition.Used as a sole reference, the book is lacking in many crucial details, but there are more specialized books available to those who find that the information within these pages is less than desired.True, it will not go in-depth with regard to each individual species, and may not show one in particular, but it's a handier starting point for arachnid identification than its larger brethren and, that, I think, is the purpose for which it is intended to be used.The bottom line: if you know little to nothing about arachnids at this time, or you just need a field guide to get you started on making identifications, go ahead and buy Levi's little gem. If you feel like you need to learn all that can be learned about an individual species of spider or need more specialized/more advanced field guides, then this is probably not the book for you.",positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),3.0,needs updating,"this book is more of a minaturized field guide,..in size (it's about 6"" x 4"" wide) and in regards to information. there is not that much information but the line drawings help with identifying spiders. i would have liked to see more writen information on the spiders as well as actual pictures. overall for the price it's a nice book to have. i've actually used it several times to identify spiders in my garden.",neutral
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),4.0,Good Starter book,I think this is a good starter book for identfying spiders that are more common. There are a couple of pages on webs that I found interesting. In the front it gives a great visual on how the Arthropod group is broken out and how different spider types break out within that - all helps when trying to do the id. There are so many different amazing spiders - this can only scrath the surface but is a really good place to start. I just like taking pictures and having a general idea of what I'm looking at so for me it works...I will be checking out other books too though like &quot;How to Know Spiders&quot; if there is one in that &quot;How to Know&quot; series.,positive
1582381569,Spiders and Their Kin (Golden Guide),5.0,A beginner-friendly guide,"First, like all of the Golden Guides, this handy little book is written for beginners -- it introduces the science of spiders in such a way that both enthusiastic kids and interested adults are able to comprehend and appreciate the topic. Even so, it's not the lightest of reading. Here's a sample sentence from the book, picked entirely at random: ""Pirate spiders are recognized by the row of strong curved setae on the front margins of the lower segments of the first pair of legs."" Do a pop quiz on the next 12 people you see, and ask them what ""setae"" are.What makes Golden Guides appealing to young people is the attractive illustrative style. As an illustrator and photographer, I've found that hand drawn or painted pictures tend to capture the imagination of young people and put them more at ease with text that may be more challenging. The book's illustrations are accurate, if occasionally not as crisp and detailed as one would like for identification purposes.Another characteristic of Golden Guides is that they are most helpful for identifying a limited - although not small - number of common species. If the specimen in question isn't in the book, you may still be able to find clues as to similar species within the group so that you can go on to track down the bug or fossil or flower or spider in question. Every book has a limit, and with nearly 40,000 spider species identified worldwide, I've yet to see a definitive guide to all of them! By my estimate, this book contains about two hundred spiders and an assortment of mites, tics, and scorpions. Oddly enough, it also includes millipedes and centipedes, which are a different group of arthropods altogether.I've been reading Golden Guides since I was a geeky little nature kid. I still have a full set of them, and whenever I give away a copy to a budding naturalist (of any age), it must be replaced. The books have been around for many years, but that doesn't mean the information is dated. The most recent revision for ""Spiders and Their Kin,"" for example, is 2002. Interestingly, early guides are very collectible and at least one website is devoted to collecting them.All of the Golden Guides are well written, beautifully illustrated, and they make excellent family nature guides. Grab a magnifying glass, a few Golden Guides, and Mom, Dad and the kids are ready to hit the trail!",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,4.0,I enjoyed this classic story,"Most everyone is generally familiar with the story of Pinocchio, although this familiarity is usually the result of the Walt Disney animated film. Actually, the movie does a reasonably good job of following the book, although it leaves a lot out and makes quite a few changes. A master carpenter named Anthony, whom everyone calls Maestro Cherry, comes across a piece of magic wood. He gives it to his friend Geppetto, a puppeteer who fashions a puppet whom he names Pinocchio. The puppet immediately runs off. Geppetto chases him and is put in jail when he tries to punish his wayward puppet. When Pinocchio returns home, the Talking Cricket tries to warn him about the error of his ways, but he kills it with a hammer, though it reappears two or three times later as a ghost.Geppetto gets out of jail, but instead of going to school Pinocchio wanders off again to see a puppet show and is taken by the puppeteer Swallowfire who eventually releases him and sends him back to Geppetto with five coins. However, Pinocchio meets the Fox and the Cat, who talk him into going to the Field of Miracles in the land of Boobies where they tell him he can plant his five coins and they will grow into thousands. The two swindle him out of one coin for dinner and then leave him at an inn. When Pinocchio goes out to find them, they disguise themselves, try to rob him, and eventually hang him. He is saved by a little girl who turns out to be ""the fairy with the blue hair."" She invites him to live with her and even sends for Geppetto, but he follows the Fox and Cat again and loses his coins to them. Later, after several other adventures, he returns to find that the little girl has died and shortly after that learns that Geppetto went to sea in search of him and was lost, perhaps swallowed by the great shark (not Monstro the whale) swimming in that area. He even ends up with his friend Candle-Wick in ""The Land of Toys"" and turns into a donkey. Will Pinocchio ever make it home? Will he find his Papa? Will he see the Blue Fairy again?It appears that Collodi, penname for Carlo Lorenzini, originally had not intended the novel as children's literature. However, the first fifteen chapters, at the unhappy ending of which Pinocchio dies a gruesome death by hanging, were serialized in a children's magazine between 1881 and 1883. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16-36, in which the Fairy rescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy. The entire story then was published as a book for children in February, 1883. Thus, it allegorically deals with some serious themes but in the end Pinocchio acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story suitable for children. The original English translation was made in 1892 by Mary E. Murray and is used in the Penguin Classics edition (2002). The Puffin Classics edition (1996) uses a translation by E. Harden. New York Review Books published a new translation in 2008 by Geoffrey Brock. The Oxford University Press edition that I bought has ""an authoritative new translation"" by Ann Lawson Lucas. I suppose that Lucas's translation is all right, but instead of leaving Gepetto's name as it is, she translates it as ""Old Joe."" Personally, I think that I would have rather read Murray's translation. All in all, I enjoyed reading the book. Though a little grim at times, it does teach some important lessons.",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,Pinnocchio,"This is a classic and deserves to be on everyone's book shelf, young and old.

Over the 127 years since then there have been many versions published with several different illustrators but to me the best is the original, illustrated by Attilo Mussino. His 300 color illustrations are wonderful depictions of Italy of that time. He goes beyond mere illustrations. It's art! The Adventures of Pinnochio was published in the U.S. in 1925.

0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,4.0,The Illustrated Junior Library edition of Pinocchio,"This review is for the hardcover, Illustrated Junior Library edition, ISBN 0448060019, translated by M. A. Murray and illustrated by Fritz Kredel, and published by Grosset and Dunlap. Since Amazon elects to combine the reviews of several different versions of 'Pinocchio' under each of the product pages, it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly which version goes with which review. To the best of my knowledge, this version is not abridged nor edited, and was first published in 1946.Well, here's another read-aloud-before-bedtime book, though truth be told, it didn't rise to the same level as some of our other attempts. I enjoyed reading it, with its variety of characters, which gives me an opportunity to indulge in some limited stagecraft, but I think my daughter was only semi-enthusiastic. She seemed to respond well to some passages, though some others were surely a little beyond her.(She's almost nine)'Pinocchio', as translated here, should not glibly be assumed to be suitable for all ages - some children may be bothered by its images, such as when Pinnocchio is hanged by the Fox and Cat, or when the puppets friend, Candlewick, after being transformed into a donkey, is literally worked to death. Other times, the writing is geared more toward an adult's understanding, and the humor is a trifle more complex than what I would assume most young children are capable of - several scenes were clearly over my daughter's head. I don't want to scare anyone away - I never thought there was anything inappropriate in the book for us, but everyone has different opinions on that matter. If you feel your children are especially sensitive, you may want to preview beforehand, and then make your own judgment.Still, 'Pinocchio' has many things going for it. The movie follows the high points of storyline fairly well - if you've seen it then you know the basic plot here as well - but the difference is how it reflects its times as opposed to the sanitized film sixty years later. Carlo Collodi's version may be a little too gritty for some parents - unless they are ready to explore more textured worlds with their kids - but it still toes a moral line. And I believe the exposure to the oddness of Pinocchio's world - which would have been fantastic, but not odd in Collodi's time - is enriching in our too-homogeneous world.Well worthwhile, but like many classics, it is a product of its time. Some respond better than others to that - for my daughter, it ended up as an 'I like it' rather than 'I love it'.A quick note on the edition: This is a very nice book for a youngster, sturdy, and with slightly larger print than usual. That last fact is also nice for an oldster like me. The illustrations by Kredel are mostly black-and-white, studded throughout the text, with a few full color plates taking up an entire page. Without other translations to compare it to, I can only say that I didn't notice anything that sounded too peculiar, other than a decision to translate the puppet theater owner's name from Mangiafuoco to the literal Fire Eater. Altogether an attractive addition for a child's bookshelf.",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,Boys who do not listen to their elders always come to grief,"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters. The story of Pinocchio, written by Carol Collodi and originally published in 1881, has been published, republished, retold, and adapted countless times over the last 130 years. However, most people today are probably primarily familiar with the adaptation (and the depiction) of Pinocchio from Disney's movie. It is nonetheless always instructive and worthwhile to go to the original story because, in my opinion, most attempts to ""improve"" any given story inevitably end up subtracting rather than adding to its value.This is an inexpensive, short and very readable edition of the Pinocchio story. It is an excellent opportunity for anyone to get reacquainted with this talking marionette, and an even better chance for all those who have never read or seen the story in the first place. The original story is much more colorful, but also darker, than the more recent adaptations. Pinocchio, Geppetto and other characters often get into physical confrontations. For the most part these incidents are amusing, but they oftentimes quite literary result in a loss of life or limb. Reading the original story also brings forth the fact that ""Adventures of Pinocchio"" was very consciously written as a morality tale. Its aim is to teach children (and especially boys) some of the basic character-building lessons: it's important to obey your parents or other authority figures, it's important to study and work hard, chasing after easy life and cheap thrills inevitably ends in a disaster. The forcefulness of such admonitions may seem a bit quaint today, but I for one think that they have a place even in the modern world.Overall, this is a very fun little book that people of all ages will enjoy reading.",positive

0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,"One of the greatest fairytales ever written, possessing such poignant meaning within that it touches the heart: simply beautiful","This stunning tale is one that brings back memories of childhood and time past, where the consequences of ones actions and the rewards of selflessness are brought to light most effectively. This is the French fairytale that I read first, the book that was handed down to me from my Grandparents and given as a gift to them by a family friend; the illustrator Charles Mozley- who knew my Grandparents intimately. The personal description from (as my mother called him `Uncle Charles') was touching, and the stunning hand drawn illustrations, add that real special element that makes this book so unique.*unlike the first edition that is listed on Amazon, the copy that I own is the first one made and hand-illustrated by the artist before being put into print*The tale is about love, friendship, loyalty and honesty and which certainly is memorable as to remain with you throughout childhood and into adulthood with its clear message. Heartwarming, affecting and so powerful this emotive narrative will have you in tears, as you experience such a rollercoaster of events within this compelling read. The love between flesh and blood, father and son is quite remarkable and like most family's it is something that can never be quite equaled to. Nor is the value of knowing right from wrong and understanding the importance of selflessness, thoughtfulness and how in life one should put others first. At times this book I found scary as a young child (around 5 yrs old when my mother first read it to me at bedtime), especially when the young boys who were corrupted were transformed into Donkey's! It is a journey of a lifetime, a character-driven tale with some distinctive characters (i.e. Cricket), dramatic and full of intensity that has you glued to the pages - this is something truly astonishing and heartwarming.Pinocchio is a young boy and whose egotistical mannerisms and lying, has the most severe consequences; such as being turned into wood and his nose growing longer and longer... His father loves his son so much and only wishes that he could become flesh and blood again, but for this to transpire Pinocchio must learn to be a good boy. As he leaves home and embarks on the most extraordinary, horrendous and unexpected of adventures where he almost looses his life this young boy takes note of the depths of his father's kind heart and the power of love.This particular edition, 1959, is so special and which is something that shall remain within my family for generations to come. Complete with such stunning illustrations by an artist who was a close friend of my Grandparents (who were also well-known artists themselves), this is something to treasure and which one cannot compare to the printed, contemporary editions of today. The story is something quite unforgettable and outstanding, that which is loved by generations both young and old and which reminds all of us the important things in life. I would recommend this as a first book to read to your children, to your nieces and nephews and for your own personal pleasure...For when you wish upon a star, dreams really DO come true!",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,high drama for children,"No other Pinocchio would do for my six year-old grandson, who hung on the conclusion of each chapter like his life depended on it. I bought him a paperback edition to take home with him until I could order this version, illustrated by Roberto Innocenti, so he could have his own copy of the one I was reading to him.My grandson agonized over Pinocchio's conflicts between his sincere desire to be good and his stray impulses. Whoknew the tale of a little woodenhead becoming a real boy could be such a cliffhanger! Innocenti's illustrations are outstanding.",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,4.0,A Classic Moral Story Brought to Life by Innocenti,"Pinocchio is a classic story, and a very different one than the saccharine Disney version most Americans are familiar with. Carlo Collodi's 1882 book lays out the story of a wooden puppet come to awkward life, who proceeds to act out on every selfish, crude and obnoxious impulse ever known to childhood. Each bad decision brings sorrow to his ""father"" Gepetto and his ""mother"" the Blue Fairy, and brings a terrifying consequence to the puppet -- in the course of the book his feet are burned off, he nearly starves, he is attacked by robbers, he is sent to prison, he's nearly fried as a fish, and he's transformed into a donkey to be sold for money.With each consequence, his penitence for foolish behavior is more real. At the beginning of the book he's the kind of child who sells his schoolbook, purchased by his father's sacrifice of his winter coat, to go to a marionette show. By the end of the story, Pinocchio is the kind of boy who leaps into the sea, risking his life to save his father from a monstrous fish. This gradual transformation culminates in Pinocchio dreaming one night that the Blue Fairy comes to him saying,In return for your good heart, I forgive you all your past misdeeds. Children who love their parents, and help them when they are sick and poor, are worthy of praise and love, even if they are not models of obedience and good behavior. Be good in future, and you will be happy.He wakes in the morning to find that he has become a real boy, with the old wooden puppet limp in the corner.This wasn't originally a children's story, but it is a story about childhood and the taming of childish, reckless impulses. It's a deeply moral tale, often reiterating the importance of working hard, being responsible, and telling the truth. It may open up a discussion about what it means to be a slave to sinful impulses (Romans 6:16-18; Romans 7:21-24), and it confirms the Biblical teaching that ""folly is bound up in the heart of a child"" (Proverbs 22:15).It isn't, however, a Christian story, and it lacks the Christian quality of grace which transforms undeserving sinners. The moralism is sometimes quite heavy-handed, and penalties for disobedience are often gruesome. Pinocchio's redemption ultimately comes, not from a power outside himself, but from his own resolve to change when he sees the consequences of his behavior for himself and others. Because of this moral self-reliance, this story may not be a good match for children who are prone to self-righteousness.If you do decide to go with Pinocchio, please avoid the many uninteresting illustrated versions available, and check out Roberto Innocenti's rendition. His surreal, dramatic, and often funny pictures perfectly complement Collodi's vivid style.",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,4.0,Well worth the money!,"I had this same book as a child and am so happy to have my childhood memories back again. A few pages were damaged but I replaced them by finding a download of each page of this classic online. This is the real deal Pinocchio, not Walt Disney's version. It's worth every penny spent, to me. The illustrations are priceless!",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,2005 revised unabridged edition illustrated by Innocenti,"First off, to clear things up, this page contains a few reviews of other editions of Pinocchio, which should be seperated out by their proper ISBN numbers. This review refers to the 2005 hardcover from Creative Editions. This is a revised version, first published in 1998, this edition features a new translation of the full, unabridged text, more lyrical than some older translations, and quite faithful to the original Italian text. Also, this edition has several additional illustrations, and has been handsomely re-designed. Altogether, I find this to be my absolute favorite edition of Pinnocchio, and I even bought it again, to replace my much-loved earlier edition. I prefer the new translation to the older translation used before, and the addition of more illustrations and the re-design make this a superior edition.I first found this book in a thrift store, and the inscription indicated it was a misguided gift to a young child from his grand-parents... Don't make this mistake, this version of Pinocchio is definitely not intended for young children. Parents may want to look elsewhere if they are expecting a tame children's book. This is a sophisticated and somewhat graphically illustrated edition, and it is not the Disney-fied version of Pinocchio that many people expect. If you are unfamiliar with the differences between the original story, and the popular sanitized versions, you might be shocked at first. The story is actually very dark, brutal, & surreal, and the illustrations of, say, Pinocchio getting hung in a tree, are really too dark for very young children.That being said, I still whole-heartedly recommend this edition for older readers wanting an artistic and unexpurgated version of this incredible tale. This is one of the best modern translations of the text I've read, so I would recommend it to literature students and people interested in Italian folklore over most of the other versions available.The artwork is what drew me to this book when I first saw it. You simply must see these illustrations to appreciate them. The detailed, large-scale, and subtlely colored drawings are a moody and perfect accompaniment to this version of the text. I pick this book up often, just to look at the amazing pictures and re-read some of my favorite parts.Overall, I am thrilled with this revised edition of a book I already considered a classic among illustrated books. I recommend it to scholars of folklore, lovers of sophisticated illustrated books, and curious readers looking for a dark, surreal and wondrous book.",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,This is Italy!,"I grew up in Italy and this is the real Macoy. Every Italian grows up reading Collodi's masterpiece while looking at Attilio Mussino's illustrations. This is the Pinocchio we imagine. When I first saw Disney's Pinocchio, I was shocked! So cute and kind... there is nothing to learn from the Disney video. Collodi's Pinocchio, on the other hand, is a child who lacks every sense of altruism, who needs to be educated. Collodi wrote various children's books, always with a pedagogical intent.This is a book for parents to read with their children. It helps remind parents that an apple needn't be peeled, and it helps kids eat the apple with the peel. If you're having problems with your first grader, this is a pedagogical and fun book for all the family.",positive

I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was referencing, (it may be the review from the library school journal--which may have been an abridgement for grade-schoolers, no longer in print)(???). If you find a copy of this book, I'd recommend buying it. It has the full 36 chapters, the original illustrations by Mazzanti, and extensive notes at the end. A lot of care went into this project, better than most other unabridged translations currnently available.",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,A new edition of this magnificent and imaginative fairy tale,"Carolo Colloid is the pseudonym of Carlo Lorenzini (1826-1890), an Italian journalist whose translations of French fairy tales in the late 1870s became so popular that he wrote his own, ""Le Avventure di Pinocchio"" (The Adventures of Pinocchio) in 1881 which went on to become a children's classic around the world and in 1940 was the basis for the animated film by Walt Disney. Now a new edition of this magnificent and imaginative fairy tale has been superbly illustrated by Roberto Innocenti with intricate artwork of museum gallery quality. This is the original story that includes all of Pinocchio's travels including getting ambushed by vile assassins, strung up in a tree, drowned in the sea, nursed back to health by a beautiful blue-haired fairy, slaying a large serpent through laughter, chained up as a dog to catch thieving weasels, arrested for fighting with classmates, almost eaten by a ravenous fisherman, saving a great mastiff and being saved by the mastiff in return, morphing into a performing donkey, flying on the back of a pigeon, getting swallowed by a gigantic shark, saving Geppetto's life, and so much more that most readers will be completely unaware of if the only contact they've had with this sophisticated story is the Disney movie and the abbreviated children's picture book versions. This simply outstanding and enthusiastically recommended edition of The Adventures Of Pinocchio does full and complete justice to the wonder and storytelling skills that originally made the life and travails of a wooden puppet brought to life so universally beloved.",positive
0762417137,Adventures Of Pinocchio,5.0,"Heavy, allegorical morality tale","My children and I have just completed this book, with beautiful illustrations by Innocenti, as a read-aloud. I have never been acquainted with any Pinocchio other than the anemic, sanitized Disney versions reflected also in the Little Golden Books. The cautions by others to be careful with young children are worthy of consideration, for this book has terrors aplenty, both in words and illustrations, but I find both words and illustrations to be marvelous.I am beginning to ""open the door"" to the difficult realities of the world for my children, and find beautiful allegorical literature to be just the ticket. The illustrations are beautifully rendered, but some are also quite scarey. Frequently, a following page will have a small cameo of a detail from the full illustration of a preceding page which draws the attention to that moral heart of a complex picture. I prefer this introduction to the reality of wickedness in the world (in words and illustrations) to the soul-numbing introductions to wickedness rampant in television and movies which give no time for concern for reflection.Some of my favorite themes are emphasized also - the redeeming power of love and forgiveness, the association of both forgiveness AND repentance prior to the resolution of relationship, the surpassing value of wisdom and the often difficult trials that must come before the heart is ready to embrace it.I am especially struck by Pinocchio's occasional recounting of his adventures as the tale unfolds. In the beginning of the tale, his recounting is filled with blaring examples of falsehood and complete lack of self-examination or evaluation. Everything that happens to him is someone else's fault and there is little association of cause and event. As the tale unfolds, however, Pinocchio's self-examination increases in accuracy, and his self-examination also becomes more accurate.I think this allegorical tale has much value for young children, as does Hinds' Feet on High Places and The Pilgrim's Progress.",positive

The stories of Pinnochio turning into a donkey were very dark, and still leave me wondering about all the symbolism.

1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,"Review of ""Killing Mister Watson""","Killing Mr. Watson is a historical fiction based on the 1910 vigilante murder of Edgar Watson in the Everglades of southwest Florida. Mr. Watson is a shadowy character who appears in the south Florida town of Chokoloskee at the turn of the century, when south Florida was one the last unsettled frontiers. Mr. Watson is a hardworking plantation owner who considered by the local residents to be both generous and dangerous because of his proficiency with firearms and a hair-trigger temper. The combination of Mr. Watson's mysterious past, his proclivity for violence, and the strange disappearance or murder of laborers on his plantation lead his neighbors to gun him down following a major hurricane. The story of Mr. Watson is retold from the first person accounts of his family and neighbors, with newspaper articles from the period interspaced between chapters to act as a narrative.Peter Matthiessen is an award winning author who meticulously recreates the drama surrounding Mr. Watson's life using a cast of diverse characters that are true to pioneer life in Florida.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, reading most of it over a two day period. As someone who considers Florida his home state, I also appreciated Mr. Matthiessen's attention to historical detail when recreating South Florida at the turn of the century. I would recommend this book to anyone and it certainly fits into the category of modern classic.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,storm surge,"Matthiessen's story of Ed Watson-or more accurately the land, the people, and the mores of Watson's day and age-is almost lyrically written. However, it is not a beach book. This book came to my attention through an article in a travel magazine. The writer described paddling through the Everglades with a well-read copy of this novel in his pack. So, I carried this book with me on vacation. Alas, I wasn't canoeing down the Everglades, and found the novel impossible to read during my noisier vacation adventure. That said, I'm glad I've made the time, now, to read this book. The early Florida that emerges in Killing Mr. Watson is not the Florida of early St. Augustine and Palm Beach history, nor does it closely resemble the history of the American Deep South. Instead, it more closely resembles the American West in values and spirit: both the tolerance and the intolerance of people who are living on the edge, and who must respect one another while ensuring that they are, themselves, respected; the deep spirit of compassion in many of the people overlaid with a necessary toughness; and a strain of irreverent humor and quick wit. Matthiesen allows the voices of these people-some of them running from a clouded past, most scrabbling for a living in an unfriendly land, and all struggling to emerge from the muck-to ring true. Most of those voices are likable; all of them are human. This book has a tone similar to the letters written by another generation, the oral traditions handed down through families, and the recorded historical documents of early settlers, but Matthiessen doesn't simpley connect the dots: he shapes that history and those voices, into an intense narrative. While it is a highly crafted, even elitist novel at times, in spirit, it textually represents some of the best paintings of the Florida Highwaymen. That is, his prose descriptions of the natural world fully render the wild, rugged beauty of life along Florida's rivers. Matthiessen also narrates the environmental destruction of Florida that seems to go hand in glove with people's dreams of success in this country in every era. The one thing both Ed Watson and many of the successful entrepreneurs in the novel seemed to share was a common belief that they could control this world, and that they would do so no matter what or who was damaged in the process. In this novel, gossip, greed, petty human nature, heartache, and loss become forces as destructive as the wind and waters of any hurricane and just as impossible to control.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,Hell or Paradise?,"Depends on your species. If you're an egret or another kind of 'plume' bird, it's patently hell. If you're an alligator or a corpse-eating carp, it's at least temporarily paradise. This is Southwest Florida, the region of the 'Ten Thousand Islands' in the decades before and just after 1900, when the region was 'infested' by humans, chiefly the roughest specimens of the Post Civil War South. As I read the book, the region itself is the chief personage of the fiction, which is a tragedy of ravished environment. The ostensible chief character is a human, though not one any reader will rush to claim brotherhood with, Mr. Edward Artemas Watson, a murderer of perhaps fifty-seven other humans, most of whom weren't as much lamented as the declining rookeries of egrets. Mr. Watson's career as a pioneer 'developer' and swaggering sociopath is told event by event by his nervous neighbors and his own family members. At least ten voices narrate his 'adventures' in dialects that reflect various levels of semi-education. Mr. Watson's eventual fate is dramatic.Other reviewers report that they enjoyed this novel. I can't fathom how ""enjoyment"" could be a normal response to the ugliness of the community and the viciousness of the events that author Peter Matthiessen portrays. Myself, I read the book with a growing sense of grief and historical shame. It's a story of hate-misshapen racism, callous cruelty, economic and social stupidity, and environmental catastrophe. It's also a completely convincing depiction of the milieu of the dregs of the American frontier, an antidote to the usual heroic mythologizing of the pioneer spirit. It's that painful honesty about the 'roots' of American life that makes this 'long slog through a snake-infested swampy hell' of a book worth reading. One gets nasty oneself as you read. I could hardly wait for the reprise of the opening scene, the Killing of Mister Watson, even though I felt sullied by the impulse.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,4.0,Four Stars And A Wink,"So, I read all about the great to-do being made by Matthiessen purists when the trilogy Shadow Country (of which this book is the first part) won the National Book Award last month. But, wait a minute; the thing that has the purists ready to kill Mr. Matthiessen is that he has edited out several hundred pages of the books as they were published separately. Thus, only part of this book is part of the trilogy that won the award. Mr. Matthiessen is now a practicing Zen monk somewhere in the state of New York. Zen monks aren't particularly known for their verbosity; perhaps that has something to do with Matthiessen's paring down of the novel. I simply don't know. But, purely a personal quirk, I detest any and all things that have been abridged, and I've never seen quite such a hullabaloo made over the National Book Award, so I decided to give this book a shot, so to speak.The book - as all have noted here - is told by other persons and has a curious Rashomon effect to it. One doesn't know who is telling the truth at what time or, in the end, if there is any ""objective truth"" to be found in the first place. But what came across as most striking to me about the book are the richly detailed descriptions of the turn-of-the-century part of southwest Florida known as the ten thousand islands. The landscape has an eerie character of its own, described by Matthiessen (a naturalist with many non-fiction works to his credit) with deft precision. An example:""This sky in southern Florida is white with heat as if ash was falling from the sun. In the hot breeze, the spiky little palms stick up like clusters of black knives, and the fire ball coming up out of the palms sharpens their edges. With the sun up, the wind dies, and the redbirds and mockers fall dead quiet, and a parched heat settles in for the long day, just dry dry dry.""There's no plot to give away here. The title does that. What we have is a series of passages relating the history (again, from different perspectives) leading up to E. J. (or was it really E. A.?) Watson's shooting. What sort of man was Watson? Did he deserve to die? Who knows? But he's the sort of man around whom myths and legends are spun. Read and decide for yourself. I will admit that what I regard as the most revealing passage about him is the following:""And so he gave me that quick wink, the kind of wink that made all our hopes and struggles in this world seem kind of silly, due to our sinful foolishness and greed. I bit my lip so as not to giggle, I pretended I never even seen it, because NOTHING MATTERED, according to that wink. It didn't MATTER that our mortal days were bloodsoaked, cruel, and empty, with nothing at the end but disease and darkness.""A page-turning, solid read, this, full of historical interest, if a bit long on ""cracker"" phraseology.",positive

1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,4.0,High Quality Page Turner,"This book proves there wasn't just a wild west, but a wild south. Matthiesen does an excellent job in portraying a region, its inhabitants, and one person who has a strong effect on both. The character of Watson is fascinating: dangerously violent (especially when drunk),yet capable of generosity and of fathering and providing for a family, aided by his entrepreneurial skills. He is, as one of the earlier settlers in the Everglades describes him, &quot;accursed:&quot; someone who is fated to bring trouble on himself wherever he goes. He may have killed Belle Starr in the Oklahoma Territory, and is the author of at least a few killings throughout the book. In using various voices to describe the man, Matthiessen underscores the subjectivity of experience, the importance of history and racial attitudes in a landscape over a two-decade period: from wilderness to exploitation then ultimate development.",positive

1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,Horror in the Everglades,"This is the story of Edgar Watson, a fugitive from justice who moves to as remote a place as could be found, the Everglades Chatham River in Southwest Florida. The remains of his homestead are still visible today as I often fish near there.Watson was originally accepted by fellow pioneers, most of whom lived some distance away on Chokoloskee Island where Ed would occasionally visit to pick up goods at Smallwoods general store, which still exists today much as it was in 1910.Bodies started turning up missing and/or dead, and it comes to be believed that Watson might have been the last man to see them alive. The locals, including some who had been friendly with Ed, decide to take matters into their own hands.This book is an interesting character study of not only Watson, but of those who turned against him, with little or no evidence, and why. The reader is treated to some great insight as to how tough it must have been, during the first decade of the 20th century, for settlers to exist in such a dangerous environment.Highly Recommended",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,4.0,Killing Mr. Watson,"If you enjoy the history of Florida and how the lower sections were inhabited during the turn of the 1900's then read this book.

The fact that in this book the author lays out the premise of how areas south of Lake Okeechobee were breached and thus saturated the Glades with unforgivable amounts of sludge and freshwater is worth reading alone. If you were to read this book, another called The Swamp and then The Wilderness Warrior you would probably know as much about how South Florida was in the old days and how and why it's history played itself out.",positive

1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,One of My Favorites,"It has been several years since I read this book...but I have enjoyed few others as I have enjoyed this one. Using multiple voices, Matthiessen tells the story of E.J Watson, a homesteader in the turn-of-the-century Everglades. Matthiessen tells the story in the 1st person, from the point of view of various friends of Watson, family members, and enemies within the Chokoloskee community.Matthiessen has clearly immersed himself in the lives of Florida pioneers, and conveys the harshness of their lives, and that sticky, fetid overripeness so characteristic of Florida, brilliantly. He clearly loves his players, and adeptly creates &quot;whole&quot; people in even distasteful characters.I've bought this book for friends who haven't been able to finish it...I have no idea why. Too much MTV, I guess, has rotted their attention spans! It may take 20 or so pages to get used to the shifting voices, but it is far from a difficult read, and you will find yourself compelled by the narrative.This book has two sequels: Lost Man's River (told from the perspective of Watson's grown son), and Bone by Bone (told from the p.o.v. of Watson himself). Both are worth a look.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,4.0,Murder in the Wild South,"As the title implies, this is the story of a murder, one committed in the Florida Everglades in 1910. The book opens with a description of the death of Edgar J Watson, a pioneer homesteader, at the hands of a mob of his neighbours, who believe him to have been responsible for a number of killings that have taken place in the area. It then proceeds to tell Watson's story through the eyes of those who knew him, each chapter being related by a different narrator to the previous one. Interspersed with these are a number of brief chapters related by the author himself, assuming the role of a historian trying to find out the truth about what he calls the ""Watson legend"". (Watson was, in fact, a real person, and, although this is a work of fiction, it is based around historical events.)The one voice we do not hear in the course of this novel is that of Watson himself; he is always referred to in the third person, never in the first. As a result of Mr Matthiessen's multiple-narrator technique, the truth about Watson's character and the events surrounding him, even those following his move to Florida, remains ambiguous. (We hear rumours, but no direct testimony, about his previous life in several other states). Was Watson good or evil, or a mixture of the two? Was his death the work of a vindictive lynch mob or justifiable killing in self-defence? Was he really guilty of the murders attributed to him, or the victim of unjustified suspicion? Mr Matthiessen never gives a final answer to these questions, but allows the reader to decide for himself or herself. Certainly, the various narrators disagree among themselves; while some clearly hate Watson, others point to his good qualities- his love for his family, his capacity for hard work, his honesty in his business dealings. Although this is the story of a murder, it bears little resemblance to the conventional whodunit, in which there is always a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple to act as deus ex machina and to reveal the truth to the reader and to the other characters. Rather, it is more similar to a real-life crime, in which all concerned, be they witnesses, police officers, prosecutor, defender, judge and jury have to try to make sense of a mass of conflicting evidence and testimony.The air of ambiguity with which Mr Matthiessen invests his narrative would, in some books, be a weakness; here, it is a strength. By allowing his characters to tell the story in their own words, with no omniscient narrator to give the definitive version of events, he is able to achieve a greater depth and complexity than would be possible with a conventional third-person narrative. Although Watson is an enigmatic character, he is nevertheless a powerfully-drawn and memorable one.Equally powerful is the description of the novel's setting. The dense, steamy, low-lying mangrove forests and swamps which made up much of Southern Florida in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were very different geographically to the high plains, deserts and mountains of the Wild West, but in cultural terms they had much in common. Both had only recently been settled by white settlers, who brought with them a culture that incorporated much of the best and the worst in American society. The best- the virtues of independence, self-reliance and hard work. The worst- the lawlessness, the obsession with honour, the willingness to settle all disputes at gunpoint, the racialism directed against both blacks and Indians. Florida today may be America's vacationland; a hundred years ago, it was the Wild South, the last remaining frontier on the east coast, a place where man was not yet in full control, where Watson and those like him struggled to make a living in the face of a hostile nature. (A hurricane plays an important part in the final turn of events in the book).In this book, Mr Matthiessen has succeeded in the creation of a highly believable fictional world, with a fascinating character at its centre. A novel well worth reading.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,An incredibly well-written book,"Matthiessen does a superb job of weaving the known facts of Edgar Watson together with his own imagination to create a novel that is truly a joy to read. It reminded me of Shogun in that it was one of those really great book reading experiences that gives the reader a sense of history and geography while telling a story that I couldn't put down after the first 50 pages. It's the first thing I've read of Matthiessen's, and I'm looking forward to my next one - probably The Snow Leopard. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of good writing, and not hack storytelling. I loved it.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,Extremely Well Done,"Peter Matthiessen is a writer of enormous sensitivity and skill. Unlike so many of his contemporaries, he eschews the cliches of cynicism and nihilism, and retains a measure of idealism about the possibilities of life.One of Matthiessen's great skills is to reproduce the local speech of simple people in a way that combines seeming authenticity with striking literary effect. Matthiessen tells the story of Mr. Watson by means of chapter-length monologues delivered by different characters in the local vernacular -- or at least Matthiessen's literary rendition of that vernacular. His ability to make those monologues seem completely authentic, while at the same time investing them with literary significance, reminded me of Twain (particularly &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;) and Faulkner.My only possible misgiving about the novel is that the author seems unwilling to pass judgment of any kind on the reputed killer, Mr. Watson. Is this because fact is so difficult to separate from fantasy that we cannot know if Mr. Watson was truly an evil man? Or is it because good and evil were relative concepts in the harsh wilderness of the Gulf coast islands in the 19th Century? Perhaps Matthiessen decided to withhold that judgment until the two later books of the trilogy, which I have not yet read.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,Excellent exploration into human nature,"It took me a few chapters to get totally hooked on this narrative. At first, I wondered why I'd want to read a book that gave the ending in the first few paragraphs as well as in its title. Soon, though, I realized that not only is this a well-written historical novel about the early years of Florida's development, it's a haunting exploration into the nature of human beings. How all of Mr. Watson's acquaintances, neighbors, and even family members are influenced by his personality, his actions, the stories that are written about him, the inuendos that float about, and how all of this confusion results in his death, all combine to make an amazingly thoughtful story. This book still occupies a corner of my mind, weeks after I've finished it.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,Superbly Crafted,"In novels displaying typical craftsmanship, assigning names to characters who may have little bearing on the story is avoided-why confuse the reader unnecessarily! But in Matthiessen's tale in which each chapter is told from the perspective of one person, numerous names of brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, cross-breeds and others are given time and again, all the while the focus is kept on just who is Mr. Watson and what makes him tick. There may be some confusion here, but it's of the type that comes from sitting on the porch across from someone who is telling you his or her story, and you realize there isn't a need to always interrupt and request the person identify every incidental person who shows up in the tale. Rather, you are taken in by the great story overall and by the teller, who turns out to be quite an interesting character himself. This is the case with `Killing Mister Watson.' Moreover, this maze of characters and their various contrasting views on Edgar Watson tend to further illuminate the geographical flavor of South Florida which Matthiessen describes as `labyrinthine.' Just as it is easy to become lost among the mangroves and the rivers, so is it equally difficult to decipher the truths and falsehoods of the folks who lived there around the turn of the twentieth century and knew Mister Watson. I liked this book. I liked it a lot.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,A book worth reading twice,"I've read this book twice. It was even better the second time around. There was too much of a time gap between it and the second and third books of the trilogy, so I had to go back to it. If you read this book, read the other two right away. I am now re-reading the second volumeThis book reveals how difficult it is to really know the truth about a person. Written as a series of interviews with people who knew Mr. Watson, we see the man from different perspectives, but we never have a direct encounter with him..The characters who tell their stories about Mr. Watson, make their judgments based on personal experience, hearsay, and fantastic rumors. One person's Mr. Watson is not always the same as another person's Mr. Watson. Sometimes the perspectives overlap. Sometimes they are polar opposites. Mr. Watson himself seems to deliberately project different personas depending on whom he is with.Throughout the book Mr. Watson remains an enigma. In the end we don't know if he really was good or evil, or perhaps both. What we do know is the difficulty his neighbors have dealing the ambiguity of Mr. Watson, and how their need to resolve the ambiguity leads to the killing of Mr. Watson.In the second volume of the trilogy, Lost Man's River, 40 years after Mr. Watson's death, we follow Mr. Watson's son, Lucius, as he tries to define his father as a fundamentally good person in the face of ambiguous evidence. In the third volume, Bone on Bone, we finally meet Mr. Watson, and we learn the events of his life that end up with his neighbors killing him on the beach.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,A tour de force by the brilliant Mr. Matthiessen,"Peter Matthiessen is best known for his nature-and-exploration writing, but he has also written his share of novels and other fiction. In &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot; he blends both fiction and fact with the stunning result being a narrative which shows us, from many points of view, just how one person is judged by the community in which he lives.Set in the close quarters of the Florida Everglades in the early 1900s, the novel examines one Edgar J. Watson (an actual figure about whom little is known). His neighbors, friends and family each offer up their take on the mysterious Mr. Watson, who may or may not be a murderer, who may have come by his fortune in roundabout and not entirely legal ways, who may be everything he seems to be and may be someone else entirely. The Florida setting is key--just as the local swamps nurture all manner of plantlife, so do the heat and sun and lack of population nourish all manner of outrageous opinion and gossip about Mr. Watson.Matthiessen uses the narrative to great effect, presenting Mr. Watson in first this light, then this, then another light altogether. The ultimate effect is almost that of a magician's illlusion--all smoke and mirrors--everything sounds plausible until you read the next thing, which makes you question everything that's gone before.Narrative technique aside, this is just a gripping read. Mr. Watson speeds unknowingly towards his fate--which may surprise you--just as the reader speeds towards the end, wanting--needing--to know what happens to this enigmatic and utterly fascinating man. &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot; is a novelistic achievement of the first order.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,5.0,"Facinating characters, backdrop and powerful writing","I recommend this book to anyone who likes their stories with insight into the darker nature of man. There's much food for thought on that respect here. At the sametime, this is an intriguing story woven from historical facts set in an equally intriguing period of history; turn of the century, frontier Everglades. Its like a Western but its dirtier, darker and more evil.I loved the writing. Matthiessen writes from several characters' perspectives and does so in a Mark Twain-esque style. I think the author has keen perception of human nature. He paints a vivid and convincing portrait of the lives and times.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,4.0,Erie mystery set against the wild backdrop of the Everglades,"Perhaps the book facinated me because my great-grandfather is Henry Thompson, Mr. Watson's boat captain.

It was fun to see some of the colorful people of the Chokoloskee Bay area in their own well written novel.",positive
1560540990,Killing Mister Watson,4.0,Will require some work on your part -- and you'll be rewarded,"Be prepared with a paper and pencil to keep track of the multiple characters and evolving relationships that weave in and out of the narrative of this novel based on real events. If you can make it through the first 50 pages you'll become engrossed in the ensuing mysterious and enigmatic story of how Mr. Watson comes to eventually be gunned down. Similar to Faulkner's ""As I Lay Dying"", the point of view switches between characters who have very different perspectives on key events and personalities. Like Joseph Conrad's ""Lord Jim"" it explores the complex personality of a less than scrupulous ambitious man. The twists and turns of the plot come out at just the right pace to keep you wanting more. It is deftly written and exactly captures the western Everglades around the turn of the last century provoking deeper thoughts about a number of issues including race (white vs. black vs. indian), man's relationship with nature, law vs. justice, gender roles, and death. This was recommended to me by a Park Ranger who serves in the Ten Thousand Island area and I would consider it a ""must read"" to anyone who is planning on visiting that part of Florida.",positive

Reading this book, I found myself actually putting together a chart of who was related to who, and in what way. My wife told me I was being too analytical, but I don't think so; after all, these labyrinthine relationships were extremely important to the characters (especially the nuances of who was--or was rumored to be--partly Black, partly Indian, etc.) So if it was important to them, it was important to me too.

Rather than allow school principal Craig Weston to send her niece to a shelter, Tess immediately makes the long flight from New York to Caitlin's aid in California.Once in Mountain Bend, Tess meets Sheriff Smith. The sheriff is interested in Tori's whereabouts, but not because she is a missing person. He believes Tori is involved in the death of Frank Weston, her employer. Frank, Craig's father, is also missing a substantial amount of money. Tess is convinced that Tori would never abandon her daughter, and she hopes Tori did not have anything to do with Frank's death. Remaining in Mountain Bend for Caitlin, Tess attempts to locate Tori and prove her innocence. She looks to Frank's other son, former Hollywood star Grant Weston, for help. While Tess finds herself attracted to Grant, she doesn't know how much she can trust him. In the midst of all this uncertainty, Tess begins to blackout and experience visions of the past. The visions are eerily similar to her current situation. Could this phenomenon enable Tess to find the truth? Is someone trying to tell her something?

Tori has had problems in the past but Tess has always been there for her. Their childhood was rough but, with the exception of Caitlin, they only had each other left. Taking a leave, she heads to this small town in hopes of finding out what has happened.Upon arriving, everything is not what it seems. Too soon, she thinks she has hallucinated and gone back in time to become another person, Molly. Hours, days and weeks can go by in the past but when she returns to the present only moments have transpired. Her alternate identity has a story to relay and time seems to be of the essence. When Tess has taken on this other body she feels in tune with Molly's growing love for Adam Weston, her brother-in-law. But who is he and what has happened?The Westons are still very much active participants in the community of present-day California. You'll find both jealousy and love within this family. Some might consider this a different type of time travel romance. There are two separate realities with one woman taking on the personality of another. What makes this different then most is Ms. Grady continually shifts the heroine back and forth between times but she blends the stories well. You will have to pay attention to details because our heroine's past history holds the key to the present.What did Tori discover before she went missing? Is she still alive? What really happened to Molly's sister? Do Adam and Molly eventually find happiness? Should Tess be leery of Craig and Grant Weston and, if so, why? There are many questions but if you read the book you'll find all the answers.",positive
0425200736,Echoes (Berkley Sensation),5.0,"Fascinating, multi-layered, mystical romance","This book was a delightful surprise; Erin Grady aka Erin Quinn has written a fascinating, multi-layered, mystical romance. Time shifting through earlier lives, the two stories blend to a final destination. Each character has a counterpart in both levels, and the shift to past history holds the key to the main story.Tess Carson, a successful businesswoman in New York City, receives a call from the tiny rural community of Mountain Bend, California from the principal of the elementary school. Feeling very confused it takes time for her to realize that this must be the school her niece Caitlin attends. The caller informs her that Caitlin's mother, Tess' sister Tori France, did not pick her daughter up from school that day and seems to have ""disappeared"", and as the emergency contact, Tess finds herself winging her way to a remote location in California ""...a couple of hours east of Sacramento or several hours west of Salt Lake"". Tess knows that her sister is not particularly reliable, but when it comes to Caitlin she would never desert her.Stories abound in this small town, much as they do in all small towns, but Tori appears to be in the middle of everything. However, it is not many hours before Tess becomes a reluctant witness to something very strange, is it hallucination or reality? That becomes her mantra as time shifts again and again, but always to the same period. Though sometimes spending days in the past, she always arrives back moments after she ""leaves"".The town is full of secrets, and yet they apparently are all related to one family, the Westons, the very family Tori was working for. Is it coincidence? Did she discover something hidden? Did she kill someone? Only the story will tell but the answer will be found buried in the past. A great read, passionate, mysterious, steadily building; a story of love, deceit, and jealousy through the ages. The characters are strong and full-fledged within both levels. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to more.",positive

0425200736,Echoes (Berkley Sensation),2.0,A Mishmash,"Erin Grady has tried to put in everything but the kitchen sink--it's a time travel, it's a suspense, it's a romance, kinda in each case. The time travel takes the heroine back to a wagon train going west, gritty details but dull overall. Not terribly believable to start--the hero is such a talented furniture-maker in Ohio, he sells his work in New York City. Question: If he's such a talented furniture maker, why does he live in a shack in Ohio, versus setting up shop in the East, where his customers for fine work would be? Answer: In order to set the plot in unconvincing motion. Such a man could have a good career in New York or elsewhere, but instead wants LAND in California. In the late part of the book, the author tries to imbue the flashbacks to the trail with the drama of a villainous brother of the earlier female incarnation's love interest. Unfortunately too much is saved for last, long after the reader has figured out who the bad guys are despite the dithering dimness of the heroine. Then the end is a frantic effort to explain everything in a rush, with a bloody denouement coupled with a dastardly scheme in the present day. She is so busy explaining it all, it's more busy than dramatic. Disappointing read.",negative

0874209013,Halfway to Everywhere: A Portrait of America's First-Tier Suburbs,5.0,This is MUST reading for community &amp; business leaders!,"Everyone who is deeply involved in the health (economic, social, or environmental) of their community needs to read this book. &quot;Halfway to Everywhere&quot; lends brilliant clarity to a morass of complex issues, and opens a whole new dialogue on economic and community planning.Suburbs are usually written-off as nothing more than a boring middle ground between the vibrant urban center and the bucolic countryside. Instead, it turns out that they have been (and still are) the proving ground for many of the most powerful trends that are shaping out world.Only someone deeply intimate with the dynamics of metropolitan development could have written this pioneering book, which is the first to properly document the cultural significance of our older suburbs. As one of America's most successful mayors, and as Senior Fellow at the Urban Land Institute (a premiere thought-leader on development issues), Bill Hudnut is probably better qualified to write this than anyone. Period.Hudnut shows how an understanding of first-tier suburbs leads to insights of tremendous value to anyone whose fortunes ride on community revitalization. You'll come away with a deep understanding of how our metropolitan areas arrived at their current condition. You'll see how the rapidly emerging disciplines of restorative development have been dramatically bringing dead and dying communities back to life. You'll also discover where current trends are likely to lead.Anyone working in the global &quot;restoration economy&quot;--who needs rapid and deep insight into the problems and opportunities of our cities--will find it in this fascinating, well-written, and well researched work. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",positive
B000O00U1K,The Saint in England,4.0,Saint Saga #22,"This full-length Saint adventure, although published in 1941, appears to be set just before the outbreak of war in Europe; it seems unlikely that Simon, Pat and Peter would be idling about on a Florida beach otherwise, even in response to an appeal for help.This is thus the last of the pre-war Saint stories, the last where the Saint is still clearly British and not a naturalised American, and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last before the quality starts dropping through the floor and the plots (with a few exceptions) become formulaic.Nonetheless, Nazis and pro-Nazis are the villains of this one, which also features our old friend Hoppy Uniatz, in fine form. The incidental details of Florida, the Everglades and their denizens seem to my uninformed judgment totally convincing, and a friend of mine considers this possibly the best Saint story.P.S.

B000GLZWQA,The Red Right Hand,5.0,Best suspense thriller ever...EVER!,"I found this book by chance at a second hand book sale while on summer holiday about three years ago. The edition was printed in 1975 and by now (after reading over and over) looks rather shabby.I had never heard of the author before and was merely looking for something to pass the time. It didn't pass much time, because once I started reading I couldn't put it down, and only took me one day to finish.Joel Townsley Rogers puts you, ne&eacute;, throws you right in the middle of a first-person account of this murder mystery that unfolds in one day. The story and subsequent mystery slowly unravels as he takes you back in time, revealing the characters and the events leading up to the day in which the story is told.You start guessing and wondering, painting your own mental images of the characters and surroundings desribed with meticulous attention detail.There are clues throughout the book, and careful reading is required. Read it again and again, and more clues are revealed.As far as endings to any book are concerned, they're pretty imprtant, so I won't divulge any details.

B000GLZWQA,The Red Right Hand,5.0,Rod Serling Meets Hitchcock,"A corpse with a missing hand, sightings of a twisted gnome driving a sleek convertible, the lone hitchhiker on a deserted highway comes straight from a nightmare's central casting. ""The Red Right Hand"", written in 1945, fresh and jolting in the 21st century, must have absolutely rocked the literary world of its day with this strangely creepy tale of young love gone impossibly wrong. Dr. Harry Riddle finds himself implicated in the murder of Innis St. Erme, a young New York businessman who had set off to New England to elope with his bride-to-be when a roadside picnic takes a terrible turn. Author Joel Townsley Rogers spins this bizarre and eerie tale tightly around a non-linear plot, leading the reader down a hallucinogenic trail of murder and mind games that is sure to confuse and delight - like you're kicking back on a lazy Saturday afternoon a pick up an early ""Twilight Zone"" episode mid-flight.

Joel Townsley Rogers was one talented writer! Some of his gooseflesh-raising descriptions have stayed in my mind for years. This book is not only mysterious and suspenseful but downright scary.Rogers was a much better writer than some of today's authors who think that gore and perversion are the only way to scare readers, and that we can only handle one and a half page chapters or our puny little attention spans will collapse.They should all have to read this book--so subtle, so creepy.

B000GLZWQA,The Red Right Hand,5.0,One of the best Psycho novels ever written,"I first read this 30 years ago when it was recommended on some book list as ""one of the 10 best psycho novels ever written"". Yes, it is! Written in 1945, it is scary, violent, mysterious, compelling and above all edge of your seat page turner. The ending is one of the most shocking, unexpected and violent in any novel I've ever read from this time period...not until Jim Thompson in the 50s would be subjected to such graphic mindless violence.The plot is rather convoluted, and deals with the disappearance of a rich man who is kidnapped while with his finacee while driving the back country roads of Connecticut, and the narrator (Dr. Henry Riddle) who also happens to break down on those same roads on the same day. The apparent maniac who kills the wealthy St. Erme (and several others that day), Corkscrew, seems to be some sort of psychotic tramp who just enjoys killing (to the point of cutting off the right hand of his main victim). But as the story is investigated further, our narrator Dr. Henry Riddle, who is writing the account the same evening as the horrible events, begins to wonder who the maniac really is, if he had an ulterior purpose, and why his own recollections of the day don't seem to match any other of the eyewitnesses. Riddle seems to have many totally unexplainable relationships to all the main characters, as well as the maniac Corkscrew himself! As the tale is further told the narrative begins to fall apart, and Dr. Riddle even begins to wonder if he himself could be the killer....The book might more properly be called a horror novel than a mystery, although there is definitely a mystery here to be solved (and Rogers plays absolutely fair with the reader). The prose and writing style are perfect for this book, as it is the written narrative of a badly bewildered and frightened man who needs answers. The characters, every dang one of them, are an assortment of strange oddballs that add to the atmosphere of fear and menace of the novel. Rogers does as good job of bringing a nightmarish, hallucinatory feel to the entire tale...you almost expect the camera to pull back and see Dr. Riddle finishing his narrative in a strait jacket in some mental ward...but the ending doesn't cheat you like that! Some readers and purists may cry foul at the way it's wrapped up (there are a LOT of red herrings that are just that), but like Agatha Christie's Murder of Roger Ackroyd, or many of Fredric Brown's novels, part of the fun is trying to decide what is pertinent and what is not, and whether or not Riddle is a reliable narrator. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up for a nice weekend read, but finish it up before it gets dark outside....",positive

If you have any taste at all for creepy mysteries, if you like puzzles, if you want to be fooled, if you think you can figure it out, you will love, just absolutely love this little book.

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,4.0,Quirky entertainment,"Very Bad Deaths is quirky and entertaining. We meet some very unusual people in this adventure.It all starts when an old college roommate knocks on Russell Walker's door in the middle of the night. Poor Russell is a recent widower and columnist for a Toronto newspaper and not feeling too good about the world at the moment. This knock on the door in the middle of the night and the request for help by his old college roommate, Zandor Zudenigo, aka Smelly, jumpstarts Russell, reluctantly, back to action. Now Zandor is a very, very strange character and happens to know that a man named Allen plans to kidnap and kill an innocent family in a very painful and horrible manner. Allen is the worst kind of sadist imaginable and Russell feels he has no choice to help stop this monster. The problem is - Zandor can't go to the police himself, for reasons you'll find in the book. So Russell must do it for him. Fortuitously and by happenstance Russell runs into Constable Nika Mandic (both literally and figuratively), a Vancouver cop whose career is stalled. I don't want to give away too much of the plot - but Russell has a lot of work to do to convince Nika that his request is legitimate and he's not some nut, another fun part of the story. But eventually the chase is on as this odd troika sets off to find Allen and put an end to his heinous plans.This is a very quirky and entertaining novel and is as much about the characters and their personal plights as it is an adventure story. It's a real page turner from beginning to end and is hard to put down. Definitely a thumbs up.",positive
0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,5.0,Who needs Callahan? Spider becomes mystery writer,"Like a rock band tired of doing their old songs and wanting you to hear something new, Spider is weary of Mike Callahan and I think he's always wanted to be a detective writer anyway. There are many hints in this book that it is the first of a series. It is a fast read and very enjoyable. It is sparse - not as many characters are developed as in Lady Slings The Booze but it's set in Canada so fewer characters seems appropriate. I didn't notice any political statements . If you're so tightly wound you think a main character who smokes pot and criticizes Bush once or twice in the whole novel is politically extreme, please...Sherlock Holmes did coke (Subcutaneously, My Dear Watson) and how could you be a Canadian (or sentient, for that matter) and not bash Bush? I loved the flashbacks to the sixties when the main character was in college. There's Stinky, the telepath who cultivates his bad odor to keep people away. And Bunny, who...no, you'll want to discover Bunny yourself. Thanks, Spider. Please keep writing. If you could write a novel each week, I'd appreciate it. I loved the Callahan stories, but this new set of characters has great potential, too. And like a rock star, I think Spider will eventually revisit Callahan's so don't give up on that. He just needs a break. By the way, if you ever suspect one of Spider's characters might be real, I assure you it can be true.

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,4.0,Interesting twists,"Columnist Russell Walker has become a recluse. Following the death of his lifelong love - his wife - he retreats into the woods of British Columbia. Unfortunately the real world keeps interrupting. His old college roommate, Smelly, has shown up on his doorstep insisting on his help. Smelly has had a timely arrival - Russell is contemplating joining his wife when Smelly knocks. However, Smelly knows this - he's an incredibly gifted telepath - although early on, you realize that gifts are often curses, as well. Russ finds himself investigating the future murder of a family, as well as a series of mass murders. Smelly, on his island, in the middle of nowhere, 10 miles from the nearest human contact (for his sanity) has had access to the mind of a serial killer, who is also an unparalleled sadist. Unfortunately that is all he got - a brief glimpse - so Russ is floundering around searching for someone who might kill some family somewhere. Russ is the only person whose mind doesn't damage Smelly's psyche; he's so sensitive he can't stand to be near people. Russ enlists the aid of a skeptical police officer, and this trio may be the only ones who can catch the inhuman butcher. This was an unusual paranormal mystery wasn't my usual fare, but it was interesting. There was humor in it, as well, but I would have to classify it as Canadian humor - not something all US Americans would grasp.

I even used to hang out at Callahan's on IRC during some really rough years.Very Bad Deaths is like velcro stripper pants. A ripoff. I'm sorry, Spider, but you plagiarized your own work. It is literally the timestopping watch story from Lady Slings the Booze, with different characters. He just replaces Christian with a nerdy Marquis de Sade lookalike, removes the watch and throws in a telepath instead. Allen (the sadist) even uses Christian's lines about not going in for fancy torture stuff when the contents of a kitchen drawer are just as good. Russell is just Jake Stonebender with a different ""my intensely painful memory"" story. (Which is to say, he's really Spider writing himself into the story...only this time, you feel like he's just indulging his ego.)And dear gods...you'll be right in the middle of plot development, and Spider'll veer off onto a ten-page recount of a memory of the main character's, and often they're only slightly related to the plot. I know, Callahan's was full of that stuff, but in those books it was done *artfully*. There's no suspense at all, and every plot advancement occurs due to so many deus ex machinas they're practically a treus ex machina.I'm sorry, Spider, nothing but love for you, man...but this book just should not have happened.",negative
0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,4.0,Spider's Take on the Serial-Killer Police Procedural,"Everything one might love or hate about Spider Robinson's work is evident in his latest book. The good, which as usual far outweighs the bad, includes his warmly humanistic outlook, his infectious enthusiasm over his interests (good coffee, rural British Columbia living), and his witty and engaging writing style. The bad is that pretty much everyone in his book thinks the same way, to the point where a single premise (such as the fact of a central character's telepathic abilities) leads all the major characters through the same lengthy chain of reasoning to the same conclusions in an instant. Spider's fans already know his predilections, however, and have forgiven them when they nearly take over his books, as they do in (for instance) the Callahan's Lady series. There is much less of that to forgive here.There is also much less story, and, regrettably, less character, in Very Bad Deaths than in much of Robinson's work. The story is short for good reason -- Robinson intentionally short-circuits the traditional ""tracking a serial killer"" plot in an amusing way, and it works. My only quarrel with the plot is that the end of the (incredibly vivid and terrifying) villain struck me as a deus ex machina (and, worse, an unnecessary one: in the beginning of the book, Robinson set up a far more satisfying way the villain could have been destroyed). Other than that, Robinson's storyline was very satisfying. But I missed his deft touch with character. His protagonist, another of his thinly disguised alter egos, is well portrayed and as lovable as any of his heroes; but his comrades include a telepath who remains mysterious and a brawny, straight-laced cop who we barely get to know at all. I doubt Robinson is losing his touch; it is more likely he is saving deeper characterizations of these characters for later books in what he obviously hopes will be a series.Robinson is not the only one who hopes it is a series. I do too. He doesn't seem to write as much as he used to, so anything that renews his enthusiasm is a good thing. Robinson is one of those authors, like Neal Stephenson, who is the darling of his fans not as much for what he writes as how he writes. I will delight in his sequels to Very Bad Deaths until the inevitable book that closes this series as he closes all his many series: the one in which everyone becomes telepathic and the world becomes one big groovy love-in.",positive
0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,4.0,Thoughtful and Powerful,"Russell Walker wants to be left alone to die--or commit suicide. But when his college roommate (Zandor, 'Smelly,' Zudenigo) from more than thirty years earlier appears on his doorstep with word that Zandor is a telepath and has accidentally learned of a horrible crime--planned by a man who thinks of himself of the artist of pain and torture, Russell knows he has to do something. His hippie/do-good past means that he can't walk away. The only problem is, they don't know the killer's last name, don't know who he intends to kill, and have no way to let the police know anything without exposing Zandor's secret. And Zandor knows that if the RCMP, CIA, FBI, NSA, or any other three letter organization ever learns of his existence, they'll kill him with their presence. Because even being near others is an assault on Zandor's telepathic senses.All of which means it's up to Russell--the world's most unlikely hero, doper, 1960s pacifist, and occasional newspaper opinion writer to track down and somehow stop a serial killer so dangerous he makes Bundy and the Boston Strangler look like kindergarters. What Russell does is somehow rope in Vancouver's most unlikely cop--a butch woman who can't get ahead partly because she's straight--and set off tracking down the few clues Zandor was able to gleen from the killer's mind before he flew out of range.Author Spider Robinson is a long-time SF favorite and his strong writing makes VERY BAD DEATHS a compelling read. Russell is occasionally annoying as he vacilates between smug and uncertain, but he's still sympathetic. Being the only guy on campus who could put up with rooming with 'Smelly' turns out to be a pretty good indicator both of his good-natured soul and of his inability to face up to challenges. When the tables get turned, Zandor, Russell, and Nika the cop are all forced to look deep into themselves, their beliefs, and ultimately betray much of what they thought they stood for.VERY BAD DEATHS is a thoughtful and powerful story.",positive
0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,2.0,Interesting story devolves to melodrama,"This story is well written and easy to read, the characters engage you to begin with and it's gradual introduction of its theme (basically the moral consequences of being a telepath) is captivating.But as the climax approaches the adjectives pile on and it tips to melodrama. The villain becomes a joke as the author tries so hard to convey his horrific nature that I lost suspension of disbelief.What was worse than that, worse than the moment I tired of the continuous litany of 'he's so horrific he...' jokes (they become jokes) was the conclusion.The conclusion does not make sense in light of how horrific the villain has been established to be.Potential spoiler alert:The resolution involves a character doing something they were loath to do. It was however apparently a simple, direct, irresistable resolution.And if the characters believed a fraction of the horrific nature of the villain they all would have felt compelled to resolve the climax by any, and the eventual, method promptly.So it's deflating nonsense to see our heroes prevaricating and basically being stupid. One does not end reading the story with any respect for the protagonists nor the author for ruining the story.",negative
0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,5.0,The Perils of Telepathy,"Very Bad Deaths (2004) is the first SF novel in the Russell Walker series. It is set in and about Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, during 2003, with flashbacks to the 1960s. Except for the original premise, it is more of a mystery than science fiction.In this novel, Russell Walker is a newspaper columnist for The Globe and Mail of Toronto. He lives in Trembling-on-the Verge on Heron Island, a small isle within ferry distance of Vancouver harbor. His wife has died the year before and he is thinking of suicide.Zandor Zudenigo is descended from Serbians living in Croatia. He once was Russell's roommate in college. Nicknamed Smelly, Zandor was so odoriferous that you could see the fetor around him. Of course, Zudie had a good reason for his odor: he was an involuntary telepath. In other words, he couldn't shut it off and most thoughts from other people were painful to him.Nika Mandic is descended from Croatians. She is a constable in the Vancouver Police. Unfortunately, she is a public relations officer -- Officer Friendly -- the lowest ranked job on the force. She drives a pickup and trailer combination to schools and other community facilities and gives lectures on personal safety.In this story, Zudie knocks on the door to Russell' office at 3:00 AM, interrupting his consideration of suicide. At first Russell assumes that he is being raided by the police and hides his stash, but soon he recognizes his friend's voice and admits him. Zandor has some business to transact, but he first must do something about Russell's clinical depression.After the treatment, Russell doesn't feel any different, but he is interested in the story Zudie has to tell. Recently, Zandor had been peacefully pursuing his interests when a failing plane crosses over his island. The mind of the pilot is violently offensive, lashing Zudie with thoughts of torture and murder.The fuel line blockage -- according to Allen the pilot -- suddenly clears and the plane only bounces once on the water and then continues on to its destination. Zandor is left with the pilot's first name, but not his surname. After all, why would Allen have thought of his last name while facing sudden death?Zudie also knows about the family of four that Allen is going to abduct and torture to death in a cabin within the remote woods. Zandor does know what the curb cut for the cabin looks like on Route 99 -- the Sea to Sky highway -- but not its exact location. Now he wants Russell to help him rescue the threatened family from this serial killer.Unfortunately, Russell doesn't have any local contacts in the various police departments in Greater Vancouver. He is a columnist, not an investigative reporter. Moreover, his column is published outside the Vancouver area, so he doesn't even know any reporters with police contacts.After Zandor leaves to avoid the waking thoughts of the neighbors, Russell tries calling a few police numbers, but only reaches answering machines and voice mails. So he dons more impressive clothes and takes the ferry to Vancouver harbor. He has the address of Police Headquarters, but the correct building is hard to find. After reaching the facility, Russell finds the lobby personnel to be less than helpful.Finally he locates the Major Crimes Division and converses with a very helpful person in their lobby. After recovering from his shock at her helpfulness, he asks his carefully scripted hypothetical questions and gets straight answers. Yet he just can't come out and admit the reality of his case.Returning to his car, he berates himself for being a coward, but he still can't imagine anyone accepting such a wayout tale. As he is trying to come up with a reasonable description of the circumstances, a woman parks a car behind him and leaves. Then a tough looking man enters the car and prepares to drive off.Russell backs up his car to block in the other vehicle. The man steps out and confronts him. Russell is imagining the damage that the thug could do to him when the man quickly runs away. Then the woman who parked the car chases him down the block.The pursuit doesn't last long. When the woman returns and thanks him for his actions, Russell meets Nika for the first time. He talks to her for a while and learns that she is a policewoman. Then he asks her to meet him on a deserted beach in the wee hours of the morning. Since that is during her shift, she is reluctant to agree to pursue personal interests on department time. But Russell tells her that it is a matter of life or death and she is finally persuaded.This tale involves the threesome in searching for the cabin where the crime is going to occur. Russell and Nika drive down Route 99 and record the curb cuts that match Zandor's description. Russell discusses their possible actions with Nika and then they take the recordings to Zudie to view.Russell and Zandor are very reluctant to confront Allen. They consider him very dangerous and would prefer to ambush him from concealment. Of course, Nika disagrees due to her upbringing, training and limited experience.Strangely enough, Russell and Nika both come from families with strong police backgrounds. That is what led Nika to the force. Yet Russell did not learn all that much from his uncles and cousin. Still, what little he does know helps in his relationship with Nika.This novel is a character study and history of Russell Walker. It exposes most of his faults and many of his strong points. The other characters are only shown through his eyes. They all have strong moral senses, but very limited experience in -- and stomach for -- violence. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Robinson fans and anyone else who enjoys tales of police procedurals, inexperienced amateurs, and strong perseverance.-Arthur W. Jordin",positive

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,4.0,A worthwhile new direction for an SF star,"Very Bad Deaths is a new direction for SF writer and erstwhile columnist Robinson. It is set in the real world -- if you make the small concession that the real world might contain at least one highly sensitive telepath -- and goes into depth with the questions about sadism that he flirted with in Lady Slings the Booze.Like the suspenseful and weird Lifehouse, this book is a chamber piece, with only four onstage characters, all believable and at least two lovable. Depending on how much the reader has thought about sadism, pain and fear, and what her or his own personal horrors are, this book could be interesting to terrifying. Myself, I had to phone a friend at 4 a.m. for comfort. But now I am reading the book a second time.If you love Robinson and this doesn't sound like him, don't panic. And do give it a try.",positive

The worst sociopathic killer that ever lived. A lonely writer living on an island. An athletic female cop. And a storyline that swings big at a wild premise and just manages to catch enough leather to send it skyward.Seasoned players will tell you baseball is a game of persistence.

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,5.0,Well-done character-driven fantasy-thriller. 4.6 stars,"_____________________________________________This well-done character-driven fantasy-thriller displays all of Robinson's strengths and avoids most of his weaknesses [1]. I read it based on Paul di Filippo's fine review: [Google]Di Filippo's rapidly becoming my favorite SF reviewer, particularly for his scifi.com reviews. Note that this one does have a naked spoiler (which I'd fortunately forgotten by the time I read the book. A bad memory does have its virtues!).The premise is a clever nod to the Pohl & Kornbluth classic, _The Space Merchants_: with a big enough population, even a one-in-a-billion deviant-- well, there'd be six of 'em now. And the reverse-altruism genetic-sport idea is original, and horrific.The first-person protagonist here appears to be a lightly-fictionalized alter ego of the author. I liked how he (the protag) *doesn't* fall in love with the female lead, and they *don't* live happily ever after. The ""Smelly"" telepath is a tour-de-force of character-building. Maybe Robinson is finally growing up as a writer?The novel is set in British Columbia, Robinson's home, and features poetic descriptions of the gorgeous BC scenery. And amusing anecdotes (as always) of dealing with bureaucracy. The coffee maker! --which I can't find now, but is some $3000 gizmo that starts with beans at one end, and many buzzes, hisses, wheezes and gurgles later, emits a perfect cuppa at the other. Complete with make & model, if you need one for your self -- another feature of Spider's writing that I've always liked. I always liked his book-reviews, too. Really should look to see if his newspaper column is online. Ah, I see he has a book of collected columns out --there's a link on this page, which I can't put here due to Amazon's paranoia re URLs in reader reviews. Bah.I read the book in one sitting and thoroughly enjoyed it. Not without flaws, but very good.

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,4.0,Excellent and fast read,"Spider Robinson writes in an uncomplicated style that is not excessively literary.

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,1.0,HUGE Disappointment,"I have been an avid Robinson fan for more years than I care to admit, but, sadly enough, he has come to the point of just filling pages up with words in order to be able to sell a book.He starts out with a truly great premise and then wanders all over the known universe to tell it. A huge portion of this book is devoted to: describing the scenic wonders of British Columbia (nothing to do with the story); slamming the United States (nothing to do with the story); slamming the Canadian police (very little to do with the story); and extolling the virtues of marijuana use (absolutely nothing whatsoeverr to do with the story line.)I learned that the world's best coffee maker is made in Switzerland. Why that was relevant to the story, I haven't a clue. One sentence mentions the killer started when he was eight years old. This, I wanted to know more about. Nope. Just that one line.Sorry, Spidey, you've lost it. I won't be spending any more time wondering when your next book will be out and won't be spending any more money when it does.

And Spider's gratuitous poke at Condoleeza Rice was just that - ugly, gratuitous and not what I'd expect from someone who has generally steered clear of politics in his fiction - except for non-partisan excoriations of failure to back space exploration.

It is more Dean Koontz or Stephen King (not horror as much as fantastic) with some Jonathan Kellerman (Alex Delaware novels) thrown in for good measure.In other words, it is a mystery novel with a character that has a supernatural power.

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,5.0,I wish I could put in words why I loved this book.,"I consider this book one of Spider's best. Yes, Spider's heroes are often Spider-like. Heinlein's heroes were all some aspect of him too. And yes, Just like Heinlein's did, Spider's libertarian outlook permeates his fiction. But I don't know that I consider these faults, especially in the face of the book's virtues.The story is ultimately a story of weak, nearly powerless people risking not just their own painful deaths but the pain of knowing they might well fail in sparing someone else's painful death in order to stop a very evil thing from happening. Is the villian or hero believable? Maybe, maybe not. (You should meet some of my friends!) But the SPIRITS of the heroes are true to the core of humanity Spider values so much in his species, and the villian is very much the antithesis of that same spirit. And that makes Very Bad Deaths a Very Good Book.",positive
0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,5.0,fantastic paranormal serial killer tale,"Fiftyish Canadian Russell Walker writes ""The Fifth Horseman"" opinion column twice a week for the Globe and Mail national newspaper, but recently has found no joy in his work or his personal life, which he admits has been very good. As Russell hides inside his remote home on Heron Island near Vancouver, he is depressed and thinking about committing suicide as he has ever since his beloved wife and companion for over three decades Susan recently died.Russell's college acquaintance Zandor ""Smelly"" Zudenigo arrives needing help. In 1967, Russell met Smelly, an Einstein clone, who could read minds. Zandor needs Russell, the only mind that the genius can tolerate for more than a nanosecond as reading minds devastates the gifted; this skill turned him into a hermit. A low flying plane over his deserted island enabled Zudie to read the brain of a serial killer planning his next murder. He needs Russell to serve as his intermediary with the cops. Russell is blown away by the police categorizing him as a nut; only police officer Hilda Mandic helps, but though they close in on the killer, he is ready to become their predator.This fantastic paranormal serial killer tale contains four key characters, who seem genuine whether they are depressed, can read and influence minds, have doubts but take a chance, or just sadistically brutal. Russell tells the tale so the audience gains greater insight into him than the others as he somewhat filters how the remaining trio appears.

The ""suicidal"" part doesn't affect the plot at all, which was too bad because it could have been interesting. The end came too quickly, especially considering all the time he spent on his character battling bureaucracy.The most annoying part about this book was how it was used to beat the reader over the head with how ""marijuana is great"".

0786182431,Very Bad Deaths: Library Edition,5.0,Excellent Audiobook Version,"One of Spider Robinson's most interesting stories, Very Bad Deaths has the author reading his own creation (and, what sounds a lot like his life story), the story of a man on the edge of suicide after the death of his wife from cancer who receives a visit from a ghost--not his wife but his college roommate, a guy who smelled so bad everyone avoided him.It turns out Smelly had a reason for his hygiene choices.Smelly (also known as Zander) is a telepath, but listening to other minds is distance-sensitive and very, very painful so he adopted a coping strategy. He's dropped in on Russell (protagonist and persona of the narrator) to enlist his help finding a serial killer.Yeah, that got my attention, too. Interesting introspection, divergent and even tangential thoughts and/or vignettes and self-description are sometimes the hallmark of great writer, and I think Robinson is one of them. I certainly enjoyed listening to his podcasts when I was subscribed to them (a while back).

The premise is great, and it has Spider's usual touch in pointing out how bad telepathy would be for anyone accursed with it. The villian is classic Spider, too. Someone so evil, just so sociopathic, that it makes you want to retch takes a master touch to accomplish.But I never felt like the book was really going anywhere.

0679417052,My Life,2.0,the magic is not in the book,"A good book as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far into truth. Although Johnson recalls his early years,the lessons he learned about hard work,etc. this book reads like a fluff job. It would have been a lot better if he told the full truth. Anyone who has some experience with life knows that there is another side to the story. Intrestingly, this side is seldom heard. Pro athletes and other celebrities are usually portrayed in a glowing light that hide dark truths. Johnson claims that in the cities he played in there were usually many beautiful women who waited for the athletes. In the book it is implied that this is one of the perks of being a pro. Really? You hear of other athletes who take advantage of this and are slapped with paternity suits, the women are given hush money, the athletes pay for their education and then are dropped by the groupies,or the groupies are set up for life by the athletes. With all the thousands of women Johnson supposedly slept with you hear nothing about this, and outside of AIDS he didn't get any other sexually transmitted disease sleeping with all these women? I find that incredible, since anyone else would be seeing the doctor pretty often. Most of the groupies are beautiful because its easier to trap the athletes money with. Does anyone really believe that athletes will sleep with ugly women? These groupies aren't stupid. The hard truth is that people are selfish. They don't sleep with athletes or other celebrities because of their status, but what it will get for them ie, bragging rights, paternity suits, etc. Most athletes are notoriously tight-lipped about this. But sometimes the truth comes out. One nameless athlete said ""If the public knew what's going on with groupies, the payoffs etc. sports would lose a lot of money."" Its all about the money. This is why opposing evidence is suppressed and why you seldom hear about the dark side. Does anyone seriously believe that vested intrests who profit from the athletes image, who make money selling sports merchandise and everthing connected with it want the truth out? Yeah, right. This book is little more than propaganda. If Johnson were serious about helping people out, he would tell the full truth. Save your money.",negative

0312512279,Managing With Operational Research,4.0,Making Good Decisions,"Managing with Operational Research is a book dedicated to presenting the ideas of analytical decision making in a non-technical manner. Its contributors include a number of managers and lecturers who have presented a variety of topics in the Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) field. It is intended to be a primer for managers and students of the field who seek an effective introduction to OR/MS. It is the hope of the authors that such exposure would lead its readers to seek a deeper understanding of the subject. It is also hoped that this book would serve as more than a means to an end. The authors have also expressed a wish to develop a methodological framework for solving problems in management on a regular basis.The authors mainly discuss those techniques that are widely used and have a great appeal in industry and business. Other related topics are discussed, but are treated in a perfunctory manner due to the breadth of the subject matter. However, the book seizes upon an important aspect of OR/MS, that is, it stresses the importance of modeling the human, or real-world, aspects to the decision-maker. As such, it presents fifteen distinct OR/MS techniques in the three sections of the book.The first section discusses the process of OR/MS. It begins with a review of the subject and continues with a discussion of its methodology. Included in this section is a discussion of the social perceptions and accomplishments of the field of problem solving. The book continues on with a discussion of the difficulties and needs associated with statistical modeling. Chapter Four is a comprehensive piece written by John Edmunds that introduces the various models and approaches of OR/MS. He divides those models into broad groups using the deterministic or stochastic methods and using &quot;what -ifs&quot; analyses. The chapter also includes a review of the applicability of those models to certain problems by the researchers.The second section expands the first section's discussion of modeling. Among the items that the chapter presents are short reviews of modeling techniques. These reviews include references to case studies and textbooks and outlines the uses and usefulness, assumptions, requirements, outputs, and advantages and disadvantages of each technique. The deterministic models that are explored include Linear Programming, Assignment, Transportation, Integer Programming, Goal Programming, Dynamic Programming, and Project Network. The stochastic models in the chapter include Decision Analysis, Replacement and Reliability Theory, Game Theory, Search Theory, Search Theory, Queuing Theory, and Analysis Simulation. To assist the potential operations researcher, the book outlines the discussions with in-depth case studies. This section also expands the idea of the ever-increasing use of computer software and simulations to solve operations problems.The third and final section draws upon all of the previously presented techniques and case studies to instill a methodological process to OR/MS by the authors. It reviews the start of the operations research process and what can be achieved by it. It discusses the role of the OR/MS, his or her interaction with management, and the implementation of the researcher's results.Overall, this book is very interesting, but not overwhelming look at the world of OR/MS. The concepts were easy to grasp, and in conjunction with the case studies included, easy to relate to real-world applications. Of particular interest was Chapter Four, especially the model reviews that were included at the end of the chapter. In closing, this will be a good addition to MBA students taking courses in Applied Operations Research and Management Science.",positive
B00085PL4C,"Old Quebec,: The fortress of New France,",3.0,Showing Its Age,"""Old Quebec: Fortress Of New France"" is a reprint of a 1903 history of Quebec from the time of its founding to a century ago. It clearly shows its age.This book focuses, though not exclusively, on the role of Quebec as a fortress. The authors do a decent job of telling its illustrious story, but I have read better.The chapters are organized thematically and, for the most part, chronologically. The initial chapters relate the stories of the early explorations an the era of Champlain, the founder of Quebec. This section was of particular interest to me because Champlain greeted some of my ancestors upon their arrival in Canada. The Seventeenth Century was the age of expansion and the era of the Jesuit North American martyrs. The governorship of Frontenac, who tried to create a New World Versailles at Quebec, and the inland explorations of Joliet and LaSalle were, perhaps, the high water marks of New France.As the Eighteenth Century progressed, wars gradually chipped at French hegemony over much of North America. The importance of control of Halifax and Louisbourg to the security of Quebec is well explained. We read of the climatic showdown of Wolfe and Montcalm at Quebec. After the conquest, political control passed to Britain and the names of the governors and generals changed from French to English.The authors get a good start at explaining the differences between the settlement patterns of the French and English. The French, motivated largely by religion, saw the New World as presenting an opportunity for Catholicism to compensate for the ground lost to Protestantism in Europe. The New England colonies were intensively settled and became largely self-sufficient, relying of Europe for luxuries and conveniences. New France was extensively, but sparsely settled, and remained dependent on Europe for the staples and necessities of life. Despite this good start, the authors failed to seize the opportunity to explain that the economy of New France was based on the fur trade which precluded the intensive settlement which could have enabled New France to compete long term against the Lion of Britain. By the end the book transfers into a paean of the loyalty of French Canadians to the Dominion.I mentioned that this book shows its age. I say this because of its writing style. The adjectives sound almost like something from a Mississippi River showboat. Phrases such as ""disgraceful orgies"", ""hellish merriment"" and ""the fiends"" provide an indication of the style throughout this book. This is not consistent with what we see in a modern history.I enjoyed reading this book although I must admit a bit of disappointment. I gained some insights which I had not picked up during other reading, but the insights were sparse in comparison to those of some other books which I have read.",neutral

Ephrem's translation into crisp, clear modern English makes one of the greatest of all Christian poets accessible to us. The kontakia, verse sermons chanted in the Liturgy, are spiritually profound, theologically insightful meditations on different events in the life of Christ. They are mystical and devotional poems of the highest order. The translator is a remarkable linguist with a subtle sense of the precise meaning of the Greek text and an ability to capture so well that it is hard to remember you are reading a translation. To read Romanos is to enter a new world, familiar figures spring to new life, familiar stories are seen from a new viewpoint, spiritual things are concrete - the Jesus of Romanos is the awesome Christ of the Christian East, a compelling, challenging presence. This book would make superb Lent reading.",positive

B000NSGW7E,Ghost Story,3.0,The first half is brilliantly scary. The second half is a corny mess.,"The first half of Ghost Story is absolutely brilliant, and quite possibly the creepiest thing I've ever read. It's also a brilliant tribute to Nathaniel Hawthorne, Washington Irving, and classic horror stories. Straub is a master of unexplained, creeping terror. Unfortunately, once everything is WAY too thoroughly explained in the second half, and the story no longer involves ghosts or anything remotely subtle or ethereal, the scariness disappears, and the story devolves into a corny monster hunt. By the last chapter it had become so utterly ridiculous that I was reading for no reason other than to finish. What a shame.",neutral
B000NSGW7E,Ghost Story,5.0,BENCHMARK TERROR of the highest sort!!!,"1979 it was, I believe, when I became first acquainted with this stunning work by Peter Straub. It put a completely new face on the ""written"" terror!Of course, back in High School, and College, many years ago, Poe was who one looked to for ""creepy"", and ""a good scare"".....Then, Stephen King burst onto the scene with ""Carrie"", ""Salem's Lot"", and ""The Shining"", and horror had a new ""King"" so to speak! Certainly, ""The Shining"" was one super-creepy and scary piece of work. And, it would come to be followed up by this little shocker by Peter Straub.Truly, of all the books I have read in my 61 years, this, ""Ghost Story"", is the one single book that I remember and think of as ""the scariest book I have ever read""....bar none. Perhaps in the case of ""The Andromeda Strain"" by Michael Crichton, we get ""scary"" of another sort, certainly unnervingly upsetting and worrysome to the reader, but I place this ""Little Shocker"" in a class held solely by itself, perhaps touched only by Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House""...surely another of the great classic horror stories of all time.While reading this book, I distinctly recall getting up ""to check the doors"", ""closing the blinds"", and several times while wending my way through it, ""putting it down for a bit"" because I was, frankly, too unnerved to continue at the moment to ""go on"".....Sadly, ""Hollywood"", when it came to make this into a movie, ruined this scarey story completely, by delivering up anything but the story here in the movie version. I have LONG waited for someone else to come along and FINALLY turn this into a faithful horror flick....it truly would be awesome, were someone to do this book justice.I thus cast down the gauntlet, to all Hollywood, or Independant Directors, challenging one of them to PLEASE take this awesome scary story and make a truly ""fitting"" film version of it!Do grab yourself a copy of this book, and sit yourself down to a truly frightening, and deeply upsetting read.....you will LONG remember ""Ghost Story""....believe me!operabruin",positive

0255364520,An End to Welfare Rights: The Rediscovery of Independence (Choice in Welfare),4.0,Heaven helps those who help themselves.,"Another book on welfare reform. Dr. Green invokes a long tradition of writers who care about those less able to help themselves but who believes that the best way to help is to help people to help themselves not merely to give handouts.If this book were only about this then I would heartily endorse it and probably award it five starts. Unfortunately there is another issue which is cleverly incorporated into the text but is really a distinct issue in it's own right which is the thorny issue of what is euphemistically termed lifestyle choice.The book has much to commend it. Clearly the author has looked into this very seriously and drawn heavily on his work on mutual and friendly societies in arriving at his conclusions. He makes a good case for the ending of the payment of welfare benefits as we know them and the substitution of government assistance whilst restoring independence. There is further work to be done in this area and, in particular, the transitional arrangements to that position but generally speaking he sets out a good case. It seems to me too that there is scope aplenty for some serious research into the costs of social administration involved in taxing incomes and earnings and the payment of social benefits out to millions. How can we as post-modern societies continue to rob Peter to pay Peter and Paul too? However, I digress.The issue of lifestyle choice is clearly an anathema to the author who sets out his stall for the restoration of the traditional family, a theme which provides a unifying link to the publications of the Health &amp; Welfare Unit now CIVITAS. He attempts to convince libertarians that the family is an essential prerequisite to the maintainance of a free society but does not address any of the fundamental issues which confront such a position. The argument is a crucial one and one which is at the crux of the debate about what sort of society we want. Yhere is a rather unholy alliance of ethical socialists, traditional conservatives and the Christian right who together are campaigning for the restoration of the family as a centrepiece of government and state policies.This is not the place to debate that issue but in a way it underpins Green's position. His thesis seems to rely on the unstated assumption that for his scheme to work it requires a traditional family structure of the single breadwinner and a stay at home parent. At a stroke this would cut down significantly on the payment of welfare benefits, reduce the demands for childcare and have important implications for all other aspects of social policy.The problem with this assumption is that it would require the equivalent of putting the genie back in the bottle. However, while this would be popular in some sections of the policy wonk community it would probably dismay many in business who have come to realise the important and growing position of women in the workforce. That said one can conjecture a future in which it is the woman of the household who goes out to work whilst the man remains at home and rears the children.Food for thought but then one should be careful what one wishes for!",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,5.0,All history is the history of thought.,"A suberb book, one that will change the way you think. Collingwood's central thesis is an explanation of why history has always been regarded as the poor relation of the other sciences, and often not as a serious science at all. The reason for this, he says, is that the methodology and high status given to the natural sciences since the 18 and 19th centuries has been used as an analogy -a false one- for the study of history. However,history is not a series of events in the past, but rather the recreation of events in the mind of the historian in the here and now. An event consists of an outside (what happened) and an inside (why it happened, or what was in the mind of the actant to cause the action) History is thus the history of thought. This does not mean that history is just 'made up' by the historian. Those historians who amass a wealth of statistical evidence regarding an event or a period without trying to understand the thoughts or consciousness involved are only doing half their job (again they are under the influence of natural science) and only studying the outside of the action. What's missing in this kind of positivist approach is an exploration of the inside of the event. Collingwood writes like a dream. His style is a model of clarity, precision and concision. This is the kind of book that has you thinking about each sentence for a few minutes before reading the next one. Not exactly a page turner then,but endlessly fascinating and intriguing. The excitement lies in watching and following an incredible mind think out a totally original approach to the relationship between history, philosophy and thought itself. Highly recommended.",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,5.0,R. G. Collingwood's Most Famous Book,"Highly Recommended.This book is one of the best books ever written on the Nature and Aims of History. This along with his &quot;Principles of History&quot; should give most readers all they need to know about the how and why of history.The book is extremely easy to read; harder to understand. Some criticisms of the book are not up to the mark, as for example complaints that Collingwood used Greek and Latin phrases in the book, and not everyone understands them. Most of the Greek and Latin are very easy to understand, any good comprehensive foreign phrase dictionary will readily yield them. In fact everyone at the Oxford of Collingwood's day, and nearly everyone who considered themselves a philosopher at that time, could read Latin, and most of them Greek. Don't complain because Kant wrote in German (and Latin and Greek), and that Collingwood writes British English (and Latin and Greek). His style is beautiful, the thoughts expressed profound.One does not get Collingwood's complete philosophy in this book, and indeed, parts of it cannot be understood without reading his other works. I think particularly of his famous doctrine of &quot;re-enactment&quot; of past thought, which is best understood in the light of the chapters on language presented in his &quot;Principles of Art&quot; (Oxford, 1938). Much invalid criticism has been written by those who have assumed this meant some kind of mental telepathy or intuition.This book, and everything Collingwood has written, will amply repay the thinking reader. He may, in fact, soon find himself armed with new philosophical ideas with which to think about the world.",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,5.0,The most original philosophy of History by an Englishman.,"Collingwood's book is an expression of the most original reflection on the nature of History ever produced in the English speaking world. Its central conception is that historical understanding consists in the historian literally experiencing the same mental life NOW as that of the personage being studied. Their minds intersect, as it were, in eternity. It underpins Collingwood's other books, such as &quot;The Idea of Nature&quot;, which studies nature in terms of changing human accounts of it. Changing Cosmologies ARE the Mind grasping Nature and by re-enacting these various changes within the historical imagination, one grasps in its very essence what the nature of scientific grappling has always been. The doctrine here is as radical as anything produced by more well-known Continental philosophers such as Hegel or Marx, and rather less likely to do damage. I unreservedly recommend this book to anyone interested in cognition and its relation to time.",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,5.0,An Excellent Edition of Collingwood's Art.,"This is a very fine edition of Collingwood's magnum opus The Idea of History.

B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,5.0,A magnificent book if you're motivated enough,"R. G. Collingwood's The Idea of History would be more correctly classified as a work of philosophy than a work of history, as the primary goal of the work is to present Collingwood's philosophical conception of the nature of history. In terms of methodology, Collingwood's book can be divided into two main sections.Parts I-IV are more historical as Collingwood traces the development of the practice of history. It begins with its Greco-Roman roots, examines the influence of Christianity, and moves on toward the development of modern scientific history, and finally finishes by examining the concept of history up to the then-present day. Throughout this first portion Collingwood does not directly present his philosophy, leaving it to the reader to infer it from his critiques of other historians. Part V is where Collingwood finally lays out his entire philosophy of history, fully elaborating what he only partially revealed in parts I-IV.",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,4.0,Thoughtful Critic of History,"History is not a scientific process of cutting and pasting events into a sequence based upon testimony. History is an active mental evaluation of what took place and why it took place. It is the mind considering its thoughts.Collingwood begins with an introduction to history and its philosophy. History is more than events. It involves thoughts. ""Philosophy is reflective. The philosophizing mind never simply thinks about an object, it always, while thinking about any object, thinks also about its own thought about that object"" (1). This philosophy of history goes back to the Greeks who placed mathematics at the center of the picture (4). Since that time there have been ""two great constructive ages of European history"": the Middle Ages and the 16-19th centuries. The Middle ages were concerned with theology. The 16th-19th centuries were concerned with the laying down of the foundations for natural science.Collingwood asks four questions about history and then seeks to answer them with answers that the populous would term acceptable. What is history? What is it about? How does it proceed? What is it for? His answers are: 1. History is a kind of research or inquiry (science) (9) 2. seeking to find out answers about human actions done in the past 3. accomplished by the interpretation of evidence 4. for the furthering of human self knowledge.He then moves into an evaluation of historical thought beginning with the Greeks. Originally history was merely myth and theological. It was a theocratic history - intent on understanding the god in question (14-15). ""Myth, on the contrary, is not concerned with human actions at all"" (15). There are no human characters, only gods.Scientific history arose and took prominence with Herodotus. It was the Greek mind which recognized that history is and can be a science (18). Instead of theocratic, it is humanistic. This thinking of historical thought was inherently opposed to Greek thought. Because history deals with human action, and that action is always changing, then these actions are not knowable. So went the thought processes of the Greeks. Therefore they had to divide history into two sections, knowledge proper and opinion.Men such as Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy (whose whole task was to assemble the traditional record of early Roman history and weld them together into a single continuous narrative), Tacitus (never really thought out the fundamental problems of his enterprise) and others played a role in the progression of historical thought.Part 2 is composed of the influence which Christianity had over historical thought and evaluation. Here the author addresses the leaven of Christian ideas and characteristics of Christian historiography. The Christians jettisoned two of the leading ideas of Greco-Roman historiography which are: 1) the optimistic idea of human nature and 2) the substantialistic idea of eternal entities underlying the process of historical change (46).Because they believed in creation, they could not fully accept the metaphysical doctrine of substance found in the Greeks and Romans. God alone is eternal (47). With their new view they saw God's purposes being worked out, not mans. The actions were more than mere events, they were the agents used by God to work out his plan (48). Therefore, the medieval historiographer's chief goal was to reveal the outworking of the divine plan (53).Part 3 addresses Romanticism, Herder, Kant, Schiller, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Hegel and Marx, and Positivism. Romanticism needed to make progress in two areas: ""first, the horizon of history had to be widened through a more sympathetic investigation... and secondly, the conception of human nature as something uniform and unchanging had to be attacked"" (86). This provided the bases upon which the majority of Collingwood's context is based.Herder was the first, and arguably the most important in regard to these changes (88). His view was teleological, each step of the evolution of man brought him closer to the end - and in man he became his own end as a rational being.Kant essentially argued that nature created a creature, any creature, for its own end. She created grass, not to feed a cow, but so that grass might be (98). His ""idea"" can be summarized in four points: a 1) universal history 2) presupposes a plan 3) bringing into human rationality 4) but in the process of bringing it in creates human irrationality (103).Schiller understood Kant to mean that universal history is the history of progress from savage to modern man (105). Kant looked to the future for the culmination, while Schiller looks at the present.Hegel was the culmination of the movement begun by Herder. He refused to approach history by means of nature (114). Nature is cyclical, nature has no history. Here he was rejecting the Darwinian view of nature and history.The positivists' plan was to find the facts and frame laws around them. This desire to ascertain all the facts turned history into a dividing up of the minutia until the big picture could no longer be understood. They then were not allowed to judge the facts, but merely say what they say. Therefore, history was only an external look at events, with no thoughts involved.Part 4 contains scientific history as found in the different countries of England, Germany, France, and Italy. Positivism, although it claimed to only be scientific, was the methodology of natural science raised to the level of a universal methodology. (134). Bradley understood historical knowledge to be ""no mere passive acceptance of testimony, but a critical interpretation of it"" (138). The fundamental thesis of his Logic is that ""reality consists neither of isolated particulars nor of abstract universals but of individual facts whose being is historical"" (141).Bury, one of Bradley's successors, was a perplexed and inconsistent positivist (147). He was able to separate facts and place them together without making a judgment call. He added to Gibbon's work on Rome in the footnotes, without changing anything in the text. This to Collingwood is a perplexity because all information which one has at his disposal must be taken into account to reveal the thoughts of the actor. If more information is found, that would constitute the need to rethink the thoughts.The final portion, part 5, explains how the previous generations have missed the mark. He addresses human nature and human history. The study of history is founded on the fact that man wants to know everything, and in this, seeks to know himself (205). In seeking to know more about himself he seeks to know more about the past. A historians goal is not merely to dissect the event, ""but discern the thought of its agent"" (213). He is attempting to penetrate into the event and detect the thought which they express (214).For Collingwood, history, in many ways, is the ""imaginary picture of the past"" (248). History is seen through the eyes of another. Something which we possess, with which Collingwood did not have to deal, is a limitless ability to preserve events today through audio and visual recording. Even if we were able to record an entire battle, we would not have a true history. Even if we had every order and statistic detailed. Even if we were to video an entire war, from its initial conflict, till the signing of a treaty, we could not have a true history. According to Collingwood, true history involved knowing the thoughts behind the actions. This a priori imagination bridges the gaps between the ""facts"" and the historical narrative (241). Therefore, if one is to know the philosophy of Plato, he must first re-think it in his own mind, and then also ""think other things in the light of which I can judge it"" (301).I am appreciative of several aspects of Collingwood's idea. History is more than dates, places, people and events. Those only have significance in a larger picture of why they happened. As the author states, ""statistical research is for the historian a good servant but a bad master"" (228). In order to arrive at why something happened, one must consider the thoughts behind the individuals actions at a certain time. As was presented, history is in no ways a mere piecing together of known people and events. Those ideas had thinkers, those thinkers had core beliefs, and those beliefs had a culture, and that culture had a history. If one seeks to understand history apart from the bigger picture they will be left with an empty shell.Collingwood's idea generates from the assumption that the natural sciences are the foundation for all thought (315). The scientific method is not the only way in which facts can be ascertained. Thinking about thinking must take place.Inherent in the reaction of Collingwood to the scientific nature of history are several difficulties which need to be settled. If history is, as Collingwood argues, a rethinking of the past through the minds of the actors, how are we to come to a knowledge of his thoughts? A difficulty arises when one's actions conflict with their perceived thoughts. If Caesar claimed to want Alexandria, yet chose Rome, how could we know his thoughts? Are we to judge by only his actions? And then what about when one actor thinks differently about the victory or failure of another actor? How are we able to bridge the temporal, cultural, and geographical bridge into the lives of past actors?Collingwood has failed to take into account the complexity of the thought process. Individuals do not always think rationally. Nor do they always act in accordance with what they think. At times humans merely react to circumstances out of their control. One actor of history may have a rational reason why he will go into battle and engage in a certain fight, however his entire thinking can change because he stepped in a hole, a lightning bold struck, a spear grazed his thigh, or an eagle sailed over his head. We simply do not have the ability to rethink anyone else's thoughts.Collingwood attempts to limit this by claiming that there are ""reflective"" or ""deliberate"" acts which have been thought out before hand (309). How are we to know which acts are deliberate and which are reactionary? Is a deliberate act one which we have specific written evidence? This difference may be able to able to be noted in a handful of cases, but not to the extent that we are able to construct a history of a people, or epoch, or battle.In our attempt to rethink the thoughts of others we not only do have the disadvantage of time and geography, but we have the disadvantage of culture. As Gadamer argues, our individual ""horizon"" is different than any other horizon. I could never think the same thoughts about a battle as a Greek soldier. His understanding of honor, Caesar, victory, human life, gods, afterlife, and pain do not correspond to mine. I may be able to understand some of those for the Greek soldier in general, but I will never know the feeling of fighting for his family or city or honor. Rethinking his exact thoughts is an impossible task.Another major difficulty with the ideas of Collingwood is his understanding of progression. Are we getting closer to history or farther from it as time progresses? If, as the author believes, we are thinking more clearly and asking better questions, than we should be getting closer to history. But does that mean that everything we are thinking today will be disproved in the next generation because they are thinking more clearly? Isn't there an inherent difficulty in claiming to be the apex? What comes after the apex?Collingwood espouses a kind of ""neo-idealism"" which believes that the historian is the product of his own history. To a certain extent, this viewpoint is correct, for one is never able to completely escape himself. To conclude, however, that each historian can only come to his conclusion, right or wrong, because of his past, is to subjective.The idea of depravity was rejected by the Renaissance thinkers, but I wonder if that is not the very idea which allows us to properly ""historicize""? We are only able to think one's thoughts after someone else as we are able to empathize with them. Depravity links us all. Collingwood, I believe sees the mind as generally progressing - thinking differently about all because it is now thinking differently about itself. Is he robbing from himself the foundation upon which he stands - at least for ancient history?",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,4.0,Difficult,"This is an extremely difficult book to digest, and it is not for casual readers. However, Collingwood's ideas on a meeting of minds between past and present is absolutely fascinating and gets to the true rewards of historical study.The one problem with this book is Collingwood's assumption that everyone can read and understand Greek. He frequently spices up his argument with a pithy Greek word or phrase, but he assumes that everyone can read Greek and never provides a translation. Footnote translations of the Greek words would be immensely helpful.",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,4.0,Quite good and ahead of its time occasionally,"This is pretty interesting. Collingwood seems like on of the first historians to really utilize ideas from evolutionary theory and modern psychology in his overall method. He manages to create a view of history that is centered on the individual attempting to inhabit and understand the mental states of the past, and while I have some major issues with that, the way he structures it feels nuanced and genuine instead of cheaply nostalgic. And sometimes out of the blue he will just throw out an observation that's about 60 years ahead of its time. Even for an Oxford don, he's pretty damn quirky",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,4.0,Easier reads of those not well versed in historiography,"This is a good book but very esoteric. ""What is History?"" by E.H. Carr is an easier selection for the causal reader or someone beginning to study historiography.",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,5.0,"Yes, it is cheaper than the University Bookstore","My daughter, a freshman at Indiana University, e-mailed me a list of the books she needed. This was on it... I ordered it, paid for it, and had it shipped directly to her. It arrived sooner than expected, and before she needed it for class.Great Job.Julie K.",positive
B000NSLVCU,The Idea of History,1.0,Collingwood's ideas sink in a quagmire or verbiage.,"The guy has a few good ideas but, reader, beware; this is the transciption of several different lectures over several years. I use the term &quot;different&quot; loosely because each appears to be a regurgitation of the others. The book desperately needs an editor, preferably one who isn't getting paid by the page.",negative
